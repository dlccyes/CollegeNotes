## shortcuts

Some keyboard shortcuts can be changed, some can't. Go to Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts to view the changeable ones.

### command+Q

Command + Q is an unchangeable shortcut key which will close an application. You can't remove it, but you can remap it to harmless stuffs (like Show Notification Center).
