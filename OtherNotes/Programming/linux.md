## kubuntu installation
kubuntu is ubuntu with KDE preinstalled

### procedure
from win10/11

1. install kubuntu iso
2. use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the iso to your USB
	- only used for installation
3. partition your disk
	- use 3rd party tool
		- [Partition Wizard](https://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html)
			1. move/resize
			2. drag to resize
			3. apply
			4. works like a charm
	- do it yourself
		-  disk management -> shrink volume
		-  if only very little is available
			1. advanced system settings -> performance -> advanced -> virtual memory -> unchech auto xxx -> set no paging file
			2. advanced system settings -> performance -> advanced -> system protection -> configure -> disable system protection
			3. restart
			4. shrink volume
			5. redo those things after you've shrinked the volume
4. disable fast restart
5. reboot and enter bios menu (press f10 for HP, hold f2 for ASUS)
6. select kubuntu
	- (for HP) boot option -> move "boot with USB" to the top -> save and exit
	- (for ASUS) boot menu
7. install kubuntu
8. remove USB stick and enter bios menu again
9. boot option -> move "boot with USB" back -> save and exit
10. if still boot to Windows -> cmd as admin -> `bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\kubuntu\grubx64.efi` -> reboot
11. you should see grub menu, now select kubuntu

### troubleshooting
- stuck on install "Updates and other software" step
	- reflash the kubuntu iso to your usb
	- use the LTS version

## troubleshooting
### Windows time become UTC
linux will set the hardware time to UTC  
we can make the hardware time be local time with  
(in linux)
```
timedatectl set-local-rtc 1
```

### grub menu related
#### no grub menu
```
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
```

set `GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE` to `menu`  
(may be `hidden` originally)

```
sudo update-grub
```
<https://askubuntu.com/a/1182434>

#### no Windows in grub menu
`sudo os-prober` to see if Windows is identified  
<https://superuser.com/a/1392323>

if there is Windows

```
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
```

add
```
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```

```
sudo update-grub
```

### xbacklight 
**SOLVING THIS ISSUE WILL CAUSE ANOTHER**

`No outputs have backlight property`

[This](https://askubuntu.com/a/1060843) will solve the backlight issue, but will make plasma become very unstable, flickering all the time

[This](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1595276#p1595276) will solve the plasma flickering issue, but will make [Touchegg](https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg) not working

### The following packages have been kept back
displayed when doing `apt upgrade`

solved by
```
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```
according to <https://askubuntu.com/a/602> this is not an ideal solution

## partition resize
### principles
- can't directly resize the os partition you're currently on
- the relative starting position of the os parition can't be changed
	- can copy paste to other area but can't directly move starting point

### procedure
for windows-linux dual-boot system
1. create unallocate space in windows
	- disk management (native)
	- partition wizard (3rd party) (very good)
2. reboot with installation USB (of kubuntu)
3. select try kubuntu
4. use GParted to manage partitions
	- you can copy paste your kubuntu partition to the new unallocated space right after Windows -> apply -> delete original kubuntu partition && resize -> apply
	- [about moving partition](https://superuser.com/a/731672) 
5. reboot normally into your kubuntu
	-  may need to `bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\kubuntu\grubx64.efi` again to see your grub menu
6. success

## nvidia driver

	- `vim ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc`
	- delete `Genial` related things
