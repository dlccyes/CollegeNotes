## quotes
Yes Prime Minister S1E6 - A Victory for Democracy  

> "They want their place on the world stage."  
"People on stages are called actors. All they're required to do is look plausible, stay sober and say the lines they're given."  
"Some of them try to make up their own lines."  
"They don't last long."

> "Diplomacy is about surviving until the next century. Politics is about surviving to Friday."
