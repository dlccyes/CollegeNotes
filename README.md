# CollegeNotes

All of my public notes, despite the name. This is my personal knowledge base. Most of them are about my college courseworks or software development.

All of the notes are written in markdown, some with hackmd, some with VsCode, some with Notion, and most with Obsidian.

The static site is generated with mkdocs and deployed on Github page.
