# Ch7 Competition

## 7.1 The Competitive Firm

marginal revenue = price a firm's output: where price = MC \(marginal cost\)

### U-shaped MC curve

![](https://i.imgur.com/XDSXwX0.png) if lost in \[0,Q1\] &lt; profit in \[Q1,Q2\] → produce Q2  
else → shut down

**short run**: can shutdown  
**long run**: can exit

### shut down or not ?

operate profit: TR\(total revenue\) - TC\(total cost\)  
shut down profit: -FC \(fixed cost\)  
TC = FC + VC \(variable cost\)  
operate if operate profit &gt; shut down profit i.e. TR &gt; VC  
\(bc fixed cost is there whether shut down or not, so only variable cost matters\)  
TR = P×Q &gt; VC  
→ ==P &gt; AVC== then a firm operate

bold part = supply curve  
\(only produce when P=MC&gt;AVC\) ![](https://i.imgur.com/UePlKID.png) produce nothing at price &lt; P0

### elasticity of supply

elasticity = $$\frac{△Q/Q}{△P/P}$$ \(the flatter the higher\)

### changes in variable costs

![](https://i.imgur.com/NbGg2Ty.png) a frim:

* marginal cost rises → supply curve shifts upward/leftward
* in industry, price = P0 → P2, so d→d' in a firm, q2 not necessarily &lt; q0  

an industry:

* the sum of firms' supply curves → shifts upward/leftward  
* Q2 &lt; Q0

### a change in demand

## 7.3 The Competitive Firm in the Long Run

P0→P1 short run: S  
long run: LRS, S' ![](https://i.imgur.com/8BxsPoH.png)

==to p.183==

## 7.4 The Competitive Industry in Long Run

changes in variable cost ![](https://i.imgur.com/VmEEeOS.png) 如果每單位 output 上升相同的 marginal cost，AC 就會垂直上升，讓均衡 output 不變  
但若是 variable cost 按比例上升，output 愈大 marginal cost 上升愈多

### a rise in fixed cost

短期才會有好處 長期而言都是 0 profit

### applications

1. apartment rent for $400
2. new law: $200 max
3. change to $20p
4. remove law
5. change to $500
6. change back to $400 ultimately

## 7.5 XXXX-Cost Industries

### Constant-Cost Industries

break-even price \(price the makes you profit = 0 \) is constant as q ↑

### Increasing-Cost Industries

break-even price ↑ as q ↑

可能原因

* break-even price 較低者較早進入市場，較高者較晚進入
* factor price ↑ as q ↑ e.g. lands

### Decreasing-Cost industries

costs ↓ as q ↑ → break-even price ↓ as q ↑ e.g. 3C industry
