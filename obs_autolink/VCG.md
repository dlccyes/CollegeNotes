# Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism
- pivotal mechanism
- ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/U9dsU4N.png)
- payment function = max of everyone else's utility when excluding you - when including you ($i$)
- so if you're not pivotal, you don't pay anything (as you don't change anything)
- can be interpreted as, you get paid the sum of others' utility when you exist, and you pay the sum of others' utility when you don't
- generally >= 0
- social cost of the individual $i$
- \> 0 â†’ you make things worse by existing
- significance
- internalize the externality of your choice
  - how your choice affect others will impact your payment
