## Intro

### Explanatory & Response variable

```go
func (explanatory) response
```

### Variables

- numeric
	- discrete
	- continious
- categorical
	- ordinal
		- can be sorted
		- e.g. A, B, C ...
	- not ordinal

### Sampling

- simple random sampling
- stratified sampling
	- group into stratas -> sample within each strata (sample unit: case)
	- each strata has its charactersitcs
- cluster sampling
	- divide into clusters -> sample clusters (sample unit: cluster)

- multistage sampling
	- divide into clusters -> sample clusters -> sample within each selected cluster

### Distribution Mode

How are local maxima distributed?

### Mean & Variance

Same mean & variance may stem from very different distributions

### Box Plot

- median = middle number
	- 2 number -> average
- Q1 = middle number between min & median
	- median has 2 number -> middle between min & closest median
- Q3 = middle number between median & max
- IQR = Q3-Q1
- upper whisker = min(max, Q3 + 1.5 x IQR)
- lower whisker = max(min, Q1 - 1.5 x IQR)
- outliers = those ouside of upper & lower whisker
