use [[Game Theory]] to solve resource allocation problems in wireless networking systems

## scenario 1
![](https://i.imgur.com/1xZKLPT.jpg)
- participants
	- n users
		- use the same APP
	- 1 edge server
	- 1 cloud
- scenario
	- users originally use the app on cloud, now they can choose to utilize the edge server's resource to host the app to achiever lower latency, at some cost (money)
- assumptions
	- you can open unlimited (or at least n) containers on edge server without any performance drop
	- performance of a container drops as more users use it
	- all users use the app all the time
	- all users have the same preference i.e. same $\alpha$
	- the original latency & cost of opening a container are the same for all users
	- all the containers are the same
- a user's strategy
	- keeping the app on cloud
	- pay the full cost and open a container on edge server to host the app
	- cooperate with other users and open a container on edge server with them while sharing the cost
		- a container has limited resource, so more user will lead to higher latency
- settings
	- $C$ = the cost of maintaining a container on edge server
	- $T$ = intrinsic latency of the app in the cloud or in the edge container with only 1 user
		- computation
	- $L_c$ = intrinsic latency of cloud to user
		- propagation delay transmission delay etc.
	- $L_e$ = intrinsic latency of edge to user
	- $\alpha$ = weight of time saved > 0
		- low latency is important → high $\alpha$
		- same for all users
- a user's utility
	- if choose to use edge server
		- $u=\alpha ((L_c+T)-(L_e+k_iT))-\frac{C}{k_i}$
		- $k_i$ = how many users in coalition $i$ i.e. $k_i$ users use container $i$
	- if choose to stay on cloud
		- $u=0$
- a coalition's utility
	- total utilities of members
- coalition operation policy
	- pareto efficient i.e. no negative impact for all
	- creation, switching
- simulation
	- everyone's the same so there's really no chance for switching, users just form a group of the max utility number and never move again
- things can be add
	- user can join an already-optimal group by compensating them
		- e.g. 22 users in total but optimal user number of a group is 5 → the 2 leftovers join other group, lowering the base utility of the group members, but compensate them s.t. they're not worse off at the TC level
		- TC or GTFO philosophy
	- differences in containers
		- different latency

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# settings
n = 10
m = 5
Le = 0.3
Lc = m*Le
a = 2
T = 0.1
C = 5

x = []
y = []

for k in range(1,n+1):
    x.append(k)
    u = a*((Lc+T)-(Le+k*T))-C/k # utility function
    y.append(u)

plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()
```
