using Cournot model, take each other's output as give

Profit of firm 2 after fracking > before fracking -> firm 2 will use fracking.

As a result, new P = 92, new Q = 390.

### B.

- before fracking
	- profit of firm 1 = $(94-77)170=2890$
- after fracking
	- profit of firm 1 = $(92-77)170=2550$
- so firm 1 would be willing to pay $2890-2550=340$ to successfully prevent firm 2 from using fracking

BR function for firm 1:  

| p_2(given) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| p_1(react) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

Similarly, for firm 2:  

| p_1(given) | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| p_2(react) | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |

Thus Nash equilibriums are (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

**Without** the meet-the-competition gaurantee:

BR function for firm 1:  

| p_2(given) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| p_1(react) | 2 | 3 | 3,4 | 4 |

Similarly, for firm 2:  

| p_1(given) | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| p_2(react) | 2   | 3   | 3,4   | 4   |

Thus Nash equilibriums are (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)

But when the meet-the-competition gaurantee comes in, when you set a lower price, the opposition will have to set the same price as yours, so you'll not be able to get a better market share by cutting price. Thus the best response is always setting the same price as your opposition.


**Intuition**

The incentive of deviating without the meet-the-competition gaurantee is that setting a lower price will enable them to eat the whole market. However, with the guarantee, when you set a lower price, the opposition will have to sell at the price you set also, thus you'll end up with the same market share with a lower profit per unit. Therefor there will be any incentive to set a lower price than the opposition.

The Nash equilibrium is therefor setting the same price as the opposition.

### C.

False.

The opposition will not be able to steal my customers with the most-favored clause with lower price, as they can just take the same price from me without negotating a new contract. But as I only offer the clause to **some of my major customers**, those wihout the clause would just be easy to target as before.

The clause makes it **harder** for me to target my rival's customers actually.
For the customers without the clause, rivals have incentives to provide a better contract, however, with the clause, the incentives are gone, so the customers will be stuck on the original contract without any competition, which is infavorable as a customer. Therefor, the customers would prefer a contract without the clause, than a contract with the clause, to provide incentives for competition.

| Sony \ MS | $399   | $299   |
| ---------- | --- | --- |
| $399 | (482.48M, 510.00M)   | (217.22M, 562.50M)   |
| $299 | (636.73M, 186.97M)  | (428.74M, 470.01M)   |

The Nash equilibrium is both setting $299, meaning both will want to cut price by $100.

The elasticity rule is $\dfrac{p-MC}{p}=\dfrac{1}{|e|}$, meaning the price is close to the marginal cost, the more elastic the demand becomes. The major tradeoff behind it is the tradeoff of demand: setting a lower price for more units sold but less profit margin, or setting a hower price for bigger profit margin but less units sold.

The answers from Question B is not exactly consistent with the elasticity rule. For each case, taking the opposition price as given, the elasticity is bigger when the price is lower. However, in many cases, the profit margin is actually lower when setting a high price, due to the variable cost being dependent on quantity produced. For example, when Sony sells at 299, profit margin of Microsoft is 40.87/299 at 299 and 26.71/399 at 399.

### D.

- As we can see from (A.), the Nash equilibrium is both cutting price.
- As we can see from (B.), when set a high price, the deman is always pretty elastic (> 1), meaning cutting price will result in big demand increase.

The content spend effectively acts as the entry cost of the streaming market. The content Netflix spends money on, are **exclusive** or **original** content, together with a subscription-based model, it means that those content are available if and only if you become a subscriber of Netflix. Those content aren't available everywhere else, and you can't rent particularly the content you want either.

As a new comer, to make people subscribe to your service instead of Netflix, you'll have to continuously provide quality exclusive or original content, which takes lots of money.

The interaction between the univesities are repeated games. Each of them knows very well that once it cuts the tuition, others will follow, resulting to price wars.

When the discount factor is still low (< 1/2 if each uses and expects other to use grim trigger strategy), each of them would not have the incentive to deviate. That might be why the price war didn't start until 1998 despite the arrangement ending in 1991. They did not need a formal collusion to introduce deviation penalty. The future profit reduction from deviating was enough for them to mainain the price.

In 1998, maybe the discount factor increased, maybe one of them suddenly discovered that it would have better overall profit if it deviated, the balance was broke. The dominant strategy therefor became following the opposition's price, which was probably what Harvard indicated to do next.
