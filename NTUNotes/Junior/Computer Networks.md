	- link, node, cloud
	- direct link
		- LAN, local area network
		- types
			- point to point
				- simple
				- bad scalability
			- multiple access
				- MAC, multiple access control
	- indirect link
		- circuit switching
		- packet switching

## computer network and the Internet
### the network core
#### packet switching
- long messages → small packets → through communication links & packet switching
- middleman
	- routers
	- link-layer switches
- store-and-forward transmission
	- receive the entire packet → transmit
	- store/buffer the bits until the entire packet is recieved
	- forward/transmit the packet onto the outbound link
	- delay (see [[#delay loss throughput]])
		- a packet of $L$ bits (L=packet length)
		- transmission rate $R$ bits/s (R=link bandwidth)
			- can store & forward at the same time with the same rate
		- P packets, 1 router
			- $delay=(P+1)\dfrac{L}{R}$
		- 1 packet, N links, N-1 routers
			- $delay=N\dfrac{L}{R}$ 
- queuing delays
	- want to transmit but the outbound link is busy (congestion) → wait in output buffer/queue
	- packet arrives to full buffer → packet loss
		- arriving packet or queued packets will be dropped
- forwarding
	- packet's header has target IP
	- forward table
		- map destination addresses to outbound links
		- set with routing protocols
- scheduling
	- FIFO queue, first in first out
		- simple but limited
	- round robin

#### circuit switching
- resources reserved
	- in contrast with the queuing method in [[#packet switching]]
		- transmission not guaranteed to succeed
	- like reserving a seat
	- want to communicate → network establish end-to-end connection
- multiplexing
	- FDM, frequency-division multiple
		- 1 frequency band for each connection
		- each circuit get a fraction of the bandwidth continuously
	- TDM, time-division multiplexing
		- 1 time slot for each connection
		- each circuit get all of the bandwidth periodically
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/26a2asD.png)
	- statistical multiplexing
		- use statistical laws

#### packet switching vs. circuit switching
- trend: packet switching
- packet switching
	- pros
		- better sharing of transmission capacity
		- simpler
		- more efficient
			- in idle 狀況很多的 case
			- allocates link on-demand
		- less costly
	- cons
		- not suitable for real-time services
			- variable & unpredictable end-to-end delays
				- queuing delays
- circuit switching
	- cons
		- circuit is idle during silent periods → waste
			- 佔用資源但暫時不 transmit data
			- many allocated but unneeded link time
		- complicated
			- establish end-to-end circuits
			- reserve end-to-end transmission capacity
			- coordinate the operation of the switches along the end-to-end path

#### a network of networks
- interconnect access ISPs s.t. all end systems can send packets to each other
- structures
	- Network Structure 1
		- 1 global transit ISP, connect all access ISPs
	- Network Structure 2
		- multiple global transit ISPs, connect all access ISPs
	-  Network Structure 3
		- tier-1 ISPs
			- e.g. AT&T
			- pay no one
			- not 100% global
		-  regional ISPs
			-  pay tier-1 ISP
			-  some has hierarchical regional ISPs
				-  e.g. China
		-  access ISPs
			-  pay regional ISP
	-  Network Structure 4
		-  mult-tier hierarchy (Network Stucture 3)
		-  PoPs, points of presence
			-  interface in provider's network for customer's network to connect into
			-  consist of routers
			-  exist everywhere except the bottom level
		-  multi-home
			-  connect to more than 1 higher level ISPs
				-  e.g. an access ISP multi-home with 2 regional & 1 tier-1 ISPs
			-  will survive when 1 provider dies
		-  peer
			-  2 nearby same-level ISPs connect directly to send data, instead of paying provider ISP
			-  settlement free i.e. none pays
			-  tier-1 ISPs peer
		-  IXP, Internet Exchange Point
			-  third-party company
			-  provide a meeting point for multiple ISPs to peer
			-  standalone building with its own switches
	-  Network Structure 5
		-  Network Structure 4
		-  content-provider networks
			-  e.g. Google
			-  data centers are interconnected privately, separated from the public Internet
			-  peer with lower-tier ISPs
				-  directly or through IXP
				-  settlement free → reduce payment to upper-tier ISPs
			-  connect to tier-1 ISPs
				-  pay

### delay, loss & throughput
- reliability
	- 原汁原味
		- error-free
			- 測不出 error
		- in-sequence
			- 原有順序
		- no duplication
		- no loss
	- failure
		- bit level
			- wired $10^{-12}$
			- wireless $10^{-5}$
		- packet level
		- node/link level
			- power off
			- 系統問題
			- virus
- QoS, quality of service
	- error rate
	- delay
		- delay jitter
			- variance of delay
			- 不同 packet 間 delay 的差異
	- throughput
		- data transfer rate between sender & receiver
		- instantaneous rate
		- average rate
		- determined by the min rate link
			- 還有多少人在分
- delay/latency
	- one-way delay
	- RTT, round trip time
		- 送出 to 收到回覆 (ack)
	- one-hop delay
		- $d_{nodal} = d_{proc}+d_{queue}+d_{trans}+d_{prop}$
		- transmit in → process → queue → transmit out → propagate
			- ![](https://i.imgur.com/dBUCcIo.png)
		- transmission delay / store-and-forward delay
			- L = packet length (bits)
			- R = link bandwidth (bps)
			- $d_{trans}=\frac{L}{R}$
		- propagation delay
			- d = link.length()
			- s = propagation speed ~ $2\times 10^8m/s$
				- 介質光速
			- $d_{prop}=\frac{d}{s}$
	- end-to-end delay = P+T+Q
		- P, propagation delay
		- T, transmission delay
		- Q, queuing delay
	- message segmenting
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/UQu1tA2.png)
			- 1 packet 1ms, 接收完就送出，一邊接收下一個
			- take 1ms x 5001

### network architecture
- layered architecture
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/50Knl9b.png)
		- 同一層互相溝通
	- encapsulation
		- PDU, packet data union
			- header + data/payload
			- ![](https://i.imgur.com/hqoyytD.png)
			- 加上 header 送到下一層
			- 除掉 header 送到上一層
	- reference models
		- ISO OSI 7-layer model
			- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CSqX8ak.png)
