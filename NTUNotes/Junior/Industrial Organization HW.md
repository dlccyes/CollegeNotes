### Problem 1 - Monsanto's Roundup
![](https://i.imgur.com/6Avfj50.png)

#### (1)
- Conservation tillage gained popularity over time, and it needs a nonselective herbicide like Roundup. As conservation tillage is sensitive to the price of herbicides, cutting price would decently increase sales for Roundup.

#### (2)
- e = 22/(-9) = -2.44  
- max profit price = 26.55
	- MR = MC = P(1-1/e) = 45*(1-(1/2.44)) = 26.55 > 21 (international price)
- Monsanto did not set the right price

#### (3)
Before the patent expired, they got a monopoly of the product, and because there are no substitutes, the price elasticity should be low, making the cutting-price strategy uneffective.

Demand becomes more elastic in the long run.

increasing popularity of tillage, which is sensitive to the price of Roundup

increase the market size, perparing for the competition to come

- US e
	- 1995 = -9.21
	- 1996 = -2.33
	- 1997 = -2.5
	- 1998 = -2.79
	- 1999 = -1.17
	- 2000 = -1.04
- internation e
	- 1995 = -3.72
	- 1996 = -2.71
	- 1997 = -2.53
	- 1998 = -2.63
	- 1999 = -1.91
	- 2000 = -0.2

#### (5)
High market share, in turn, allowed Monsanto to exploit economies of scale
and work its way down the learning curve.

### Problem 2 - car
![](https://i.imgur.com/ceAjMqX.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/InSTSZo.png)

#### (1) 
the change of price of a car obviously affects the quantity of the car itself the most

#### (2)
sales of Taurus increases as price of Accord increases, so they're substitutes

#### (3)
Accord  
highest cross elasticity, meaning the substitute level is the highest

#### (4)
cross elasticity > 0  
-> Century's sells goes down when Cavalier's price decrease

#### (5)
- lower-end consumers are more price sensitive
- there are more competitors in the lower-end market

#### (6)
- Accord Q up about 9.3% = 27.9k
- Accord P down 2% -> Accord Q up 9.6%  
- Taurus P down 3% -> Accord Q down 0.3%  

### Water
![](https://i.imgur.com/VzDzoHA.png)

#### (1)
bigger the total annual consumption, higher the elasticity
- essential consumptions are inelastic

#### (2)
rich
- rich households use more water than poor ones, yet pay the same

#### (3)
underestimated
- when facing a flat charge, the quantity of consumption does not affect the charge at all, meaning the marginal cost of using water is 0, so the calculated price elasticity would be very low

#### (4)
It should only be meaningful for people facing volume-based charge. For people facing flat charge, they would not reduce their water consumption at all.

### Durable Goods

#### (1)
- p1 = 450
- q1 = 400
- p2 = 150
- q2 = 300

#### (2)
- 225000
- 250000

#### (3)
賣一次
500, 250

#### (4)
sell once

## HW2
### Problem 1 - Bundling of Office Suites
![](https://i.imgur.com/EgLxs4o.png)

#### (1)
- $300 for Word
	- 100x5 = 500
	- 200x4 = 800
	- 300x3 = 900
	- 400x2 = 800
- same for excel

#### (2)
- $500
	- 500x5 = 2500
	- 600x3 = 1800

![](https://i.imgur.com/kRQEdof.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/pADh6Wm.png)

#### (3)
$profit=(P-MC)(1-\dfrac{P}{400})10M=P(1-\dfrac{P}{400})10M$

profit maximized when P = 200

#### (4)
if sell seperately, total profit = 200x5Mx2 = 2B

![](https://i.imgur.com/RMgHp5Z.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/EjEmRo2.png)

if sell in a bundle, profit = 2.177B > 2B when P = 326.599
<https://math.stackexchange.com/a/357842>

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZRrdfhR.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/t9We04G.png)

#### (5)
sell at price = $200-\epsilon$ for both
profit = 200x5Mx2 - 500M > 0, so yes

#### (6)
sell at price = $326.599-\epsilon$ 
profit = 2.177B - 500M > 0, so yes

#### (7)
sell at a price so that total profit = 500M

- if sell seperately
	- $2P(1-\dfrac{P}{400})10M=500M$  
	- $P^2-400P+10000=0$
	- P=26.795 (373.02 不合)
- if sell as a bundle
	- $(P-\dfrac{P^3}{2\times 400^2})10M=500M$
	- P = 50.400

### Problem 2 - location choice 
![](https://i.imgur.com/sWhHplz.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/wYdWNBq.png)

#### (1)
2 shops, at 0.25 & 0.75

- earn 3003 from each customer 
	- $\sum_{k=0}^\infty \dfrac{4-1}{1.001^k}=3003$
- each shop need at least $\dfrac{600000}{3003}=199.8$ customers to have positive profit
- the country can have $\dfrac{1000}{200}=5$ shops max
- max 0.5 miles between 2 shops
- 2 shops for max profit, placed in 0.25 & 0.75

#### (2)
open 4 shops, at $0.25-\epsilon$, $0.25+\epsilon$, $0.75-\epsilon$, $0.75+\epsilon$

#### (3)
open 3 shops, at 0.2, 0,5, 0.8

#### (4)
- no change for (1)
- some changes for (2)
	- CS Burgers would set price = $4-\epsilon$ and set up at $0.25\pm\epsilon$, $0.75\pm\epsilon$, this way they can get almost all customers
- for (3)
	- opposition can set price slightly lower than mine and steal away all customers, 500 customers max
	- so set at 0.25 & 0.75 and set at price just enough to have profit with 500 customers
		- 600000/500 = 1200
		- 1200/1001 = 1.198
		- so set price = 2.2

#### (5)
- if all information of each competitor is known, then first-mover has advantage
- if competitors' info not known, then second-mover advantage

#### (6)
- 7-11 & family mart
	- almost identical, perfect substitutes
- vending machine

### Problem 3 - Coors in the 1970s
**scenario**
- Coors, A-B, Miller are 3 beer manufacturers in competition
- Coors is in the west, while A-B & Miller in the east, so Coors dominates in the west
- Coors doesn't spend big money on ad
- A-B & Miller spend big money on ad
- A-B wants to set up in the west
	- if Coors does nothing, A-B will have positive ROI 
	- if Coors conducts a marketing campaign, A-B will not have pcositive ROI
		- before or during A-B the construction the plant
	- the cost of settlement is spent preemptively, so once the construction starts, there's no going back
- Coors has 3 strats to responds to A-B's possible expansion
	- conducts a marketing campaign preemptively
	- declares if A-B or Miller comes, they'll conduct a marketing campaign
	- does nothing1



**Analyze the three scenarios using game theory and then recommend an action to Coors management.**

2nd strategy, declares if A-B or Miller comes, they'll conduct a marketing campaign

## HW3
- Aspartame is a very good sweetener, used in soft drinks
- Monsanto has the patent of aspartame, branded as NutraSweet
- HSC starts selling aspartament in Europe after the patent expired in Europe, but then NutraSweet cuts the price from $70 to $22-$30 per pounds
	- HSC thus has negative profits
	- Monsanto's revenue is also greatly reduced
	- background
		- patent expired few years earlier in Europe (small market) than in US (huge market)
		- Monsanto cuts cost of aspartame production by 70% over 10 years
	- intepretation
		- Monsanto 殺雞儆猴, telling others don't even try to enter big markets like US when the patent expires
		- slows down the production cost reduction of HSC
	- result
		- HSC slow down expansion
		- HSC's not much of a competitor when US market opens
		- Monsanto signs long-term contracts with Coke & Pessi before patent expires

- Monsanto's a huge firm with many products
