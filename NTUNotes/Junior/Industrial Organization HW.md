## HW1
### Problem 1 - Monsanto's Roundup

#### (1)
0.91x1.22 > 1

#### (2)
- e = 22/(-9) = -2.44  
- max profit price  = ??
- Monsanto did not set the right price

#### (3)
Before the patent expired, they got a monopoly of the product, and because there are no substitutes, the price elasticity should be low, making the cutting-price strategy uneffective.

Demand becomes more elastic in the long run.


### Problem 2 - car

#### (1) 
the change of price of a car obviously affects the quantity of the car itself the most

#### (2)
sells of Taurus increases as price of Accord increases, so they're substitutes

#### (3)
Accord  
highest cross elasticity, meaning the substitute level is the highest

#### (4)
cross elasticity > 0  
-> Century's sells goes down when Cavalier's price decrease

#### (5)
- lower-end consumers are more price sensitive
- there are more competitors in the lower-end market

#### (6)
- Accord Q up about 9.3% = 27.9k
- Accord P down 2% -> Accord Q up 9.6%  
- Taurus P down 3% -> Accord Q down 0.3%  

### Water

#### (1)
bigger the total annual consumption, higher the elasticity
- essential consumptions are inelastic

#### (2)
rich
- rich households use more water than poor ones, yet pay the same

#### (3)
underetimated
- when facing a flat charge, the quantity of consumption does not affect the charge at all, so the calculated price elasticity would be very low
