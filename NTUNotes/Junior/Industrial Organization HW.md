#### (1) 
the change of price of a car obviously affects the quantity of the car itself the most

#### (2)
sells of Taurus increases as price of Accord increases, so they're substitutes

#### (3)
Accord  
highest cross elasticity, meaning the substitute level is the highest

#### (4)
cross elasticity > 0  
-> Century's sells goes down when Cavalier's price decrease

#### (5)
- lower-end consumers are more price sensitive
- there are more competitors in the lower-end market

#### (6)
- Accord Q up about 9.3% = 27.9k
- Accord P down 2% -> Accord Q up 9.6%  
- Taurus P down 3% -> Accord Q down 0.3%
