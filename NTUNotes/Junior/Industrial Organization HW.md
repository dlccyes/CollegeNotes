### Problem 1 - Monsanto's Roundup
![](https://i.imgur.com/6Avfj50.png)

#### (1)
- Conservation tillage gained popularity over time, and it needs a nonselective herbicide like Roundup. As conservation tillage is sensitive to the price of herbicides, cutting price would decently increase sales for Roundup.

#### (2)
- e = 22/(-9) = -2.44  
- max profit price = 26.55
	- MR = MC = P(1-1/e) = 45*(1-(1/2.44)) = 26.55 > 21 (international price)
- Monsanto did not set the right price

#### (3)
Before the patent expired, they got a monopoly of the product, and because there are no substitutes, the price elasticity should be low, making the cutting-price strategy uneffective.

Demand becomes more elastic in the long run.

increasing popularity of tillage, which is sensitive to the price of Roundup

increase the market size, perparing for the competition to come

#### (4)

- US e
	- 1995 = -9.21
	- 1996 = -2.33
	- 1997 = -2.5
	- 1998 = -2.79
	- 1999 = -1.17
	- 2000 = -1.04
- internation e
	- 1995 = -3.72
	- 1996 = -2.71
	- 1997 = -2.53
	- 1998 = -2.63
	- 1999 = -1.91
	- 2000 = -0.2

#### (5)
High market share, in turn, allowed Monsanto to exploit economies of scale
and work its way down the learning curve.

### Problem 2 - car
![](https://i.imgur.com/ceAjMqX.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/InSTSZo.png)

#### (1) 
the change of price of a car obviously affects the quantity of the car itself the most

#### (2)
sales of Taurus increases as price of Accord increases, so they're substitutes

#### (3)
Accord  
highest cross elasticity, meaning the substitute level is the highest

#### (4)
cross elasticity > 0  
-> Century's sells goes down when Cavalier's price decrease

#### (5)
- lower-end consumers are more price sensitive
- there are more competitors in the lower-end market

#### (6)
- Accord Q up about 9.3% = 27.9k
- Accord P down 2% -> Accord Q up 9.6%  
- Taurus P down 3% -> Accord Q down 0.3%  

### Water
![](https://i.imgur.com/VzDzoHA.png)

#### (1)
bigger the total annual consumption, higher the elasticity
- essential consumptions are inelastic

#### (2)
rich
- rich households use more water than poor ones, yet pay the same

#### (3)
underestimated
- when facing a flat charge, the quantity of consumption does not affect the charge at all, meaning the marginal cost of using water is 0, so the calculated price elasticity would be very low

#### (4)
It should only be meaningful for people facing volume-based charge. For people facing flat charge, they would not reduce their water consumption at all.

### Durable Goods
![](https://i.imgur.com/nlzjdnL.png)

#### (1)
- p1 = 450
- q1 = 400
- p2 = 150
- q2 = 300

#### (2)
- 225000
- 250000

#### (3)
賣一次
500, 250

#### (4)
sell once

### Problem 1 - Bundling of Office Suites
![](https://i.imgur.com/EgLxs4o.png)

#### (1)
- $300 for Word
	- 100x5 = 500
	- 200x4 = 800
	- 300x3 = 900
	- 400x2 = 800
- same for excel

#### (2)
- $500
	- 500x5 = 2500
	- 600x3 = 1800

![](https://i.imgur.com/kRQEdof.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/pADh6Wm.png)

#### (3)
$profit=(P-MC)(1-\dfrac{P}{400})10M=P(1-\dfrac{P}{400})10M$

profit maximized when P = 200

#### (4)
if sell seperately, total profit = 200x5Mx2 = 2B

![](https://i.imgur.com/RMgHp5Z.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/EjEmRo2.png)

if sell in a bundle, profit = 2.177B > 2B when P = 326.599
<https://math.stackexchange.com/a/357842>

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZRrdfhR.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/t9We04G.png)

#### (5)
sell at price = $200-\epsilon$ for both
profit = 200x5Mx2 - 500M > 0, so yes

#### (6)
sell at price = $326.599-\epsilon$ 
profit = 2.177B - 500M > 0, so yes

#### (7)
sell at a price so that total profit = 500M

- if sell seperately
	- $2P(1-\dfrac{P}{400})10M=500M$  
	- $P^2-400P+10000=0$
	- P=26.795 (373.02 不合)
- if sell as a bundle
	- $(P-\dfrac{P^3}{2\times 400^2})10M=500M$
	- P = 50.400

### Problem 2 - location choice 
![](https://i.imgur.com/sWhHplz.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/wYdWNBq.png)

#### (1)
2 shops, at 0.25 & 0.75

- earn 3003 from each customer 
	- $\sum_{k=0}^\infty \dfrac{4-1}{1.001^k}=3003$
- each shop need at least $\dfrac{600000}{3003}=199.8$ customers to have positive profit
- the country can have $\dfrac{1000}{200}=5$ shops max
- max 0.5 miles between 2 shops
- 2 shops for max profit, placed in 0.25 & 0.75

#### (2)
open 4 shops, at $0.25-\epsilon$, $0.25+\epsilon$, $0.75-\epsilon$, $0.75+\epsilon$

#### (3)
open 3 shops, at 0.2, 0,5, 0.8

#### (4)
- no change for (1)
- some changes for (2)
	- CS Burgers would set price = $4-\epsilon$ and set up at $0.25\pm\epsilon$, $0.75\pm\epsilon$, this way they can get almost all customers
- for (3)
	- opposition can set price slightly lower than mine and steal away all customers, 500 customers max
	- so set at 0.25 & 0.75 and set at price just enough to have profit with 500 customers
		- 600000/500 = 1200
		- 1200/1001 = 1.198
		- so set price = 2.2

#### (5)
- if all information of each competitor is known, then first-mover has advantage
- if competitors' info not known, then second-mover advantage

#### (6)
- 7-11 & family mart
	- almost identical, perfect substitutes
- vending machine

### Problem 3 - Coors in the 1970s
**scenario**
- Coors, A-B, Miller are 3 beer manufacturers in competition
- Coors is in the west, while A-B & Miller in the east, so Coors dominates in the west
- Coors doesn't spend big money on ad
- A-B & Miller spend big money on ad
- A-B wants to set up in the west
	- if Coors does nothing, A-B will have positive ROI 
	- if Coors conducts a marketing campaign, A-B will not have pcositive ROI
		- before or during A-B the construction the plant
	- the cost of settlement is spent preemptively, so once the construction starts, there's no going back
- Coors has 3 strats to responds to A-B's possible expansion
	- conducts a marketing campaign preemptively
	- declares if A-B or Miller comes, they'll conduct a marketing campaign
	- does nothing1



**Analyze the three scenarios using game theory and then recommend an action to Coors management.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/60iqRy7.png)

2nd strategy, declares if A-B or Miller comes, they'll conduct a marketing campaign

## HW3 Aspartame
[submission pdf](Industrial_Organization_Assignment__3.pdf)  
[submission tex](Industrial_Organization_Assignment__3.tex)

- Aspartame is a very good sweetener, used in soft drinks
- Monsanto has the patent of aspartame, branded as NutraSweet
- Cooperate with Ajinomoto (Japanese firm), getting tech support while giving out exclusive access to Japanese aspartame market 
- European market opened
	- HSC starts selling aspartament in Europe after the patent expired in Europe
	- NutraSweet cuts the price from $70 to $22-$30 per pounds
	- HSC thus has negative profits
	- other competitors exit the European market
	- Monsanto's revenue is also greatly reduced
	- background
		- patent expired few years earlier in Europe (small market) than in US (huge market)
		- Monsanto cuts cost of aspartame production by 70% over 10 years
	- intepretation
		- Monsanto 殺雞儆猴, telling others don't even try to enter big markets like US when the patent expires
		- slows down the production cost reduction of HSC
	- result
		- HSC slow down expansion
		- HSC's not much of a competitor when US market opens
		- Monsanto signs long-term contracts with Coke & Pessi before patent expires
- Canadian market opened
	- HSC enters
	- Monsanto has exclusive, multi-year contracts with customers
		- include a clause meeting the lowest price on market from competitors
- Asian market opened
	- Japan imports HSC
	- South Korea produces its own
- new sweeteners
	- many new types of sweetener produced in 1987-1988
- timeline (NutraSweet's perspective)
	- 1987 
		- Europe patent expires
		- HSC enters Europe
		- Canada patent expires
		- HSC enters Canada
		- many new type sweeteners produced
	- 1992 US patent expires
	- 1993 Australia patent expires

![](https://i.imgur.com/2rUvi58.png)

- Monsanto provides “meet-or-release” and “most-favored-nation” clauses, so for the soft drink manufacturers, it's indifferent from embracing real competition instead of the contract cost-wise
- it has been used for years, so the quality is guaranteed, meaning the risk is smaller
- same cost + smaller risk -> more favorable

### Entry Deterrence in Capacity Setting Games
![](https://i.imgur.com/sXezvbA.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/QYz4Ego.png)

#### (1)
$R=12Q-Q^2$
$MR=12-2Q$
$MR=MC=1$ -> $q_1=5.5$
$p=12-Q=6.5-q_2$
$(p-MC)q_2=5.5q_2-q_2^2$
$q_2=2.75$, profit = 7.5625 = minimal $\hat{E}$

firm 2 won't enter the market, so $q_1^m=5.5$ (the monopoly quantity)

#### (2)
caculate $q_2$ given $q_1$
$p=12-q_1-q_2$
$R_2=pq_2=12q_2-q_1q_2-q_2^2$
$MR_2=12-q_1-2q_2$
$MC_2=1$
$MR_2=MC_2=1$ -> $q_2=\dfrac{11-q_1}{2}$
$p=\dfrac{13-q_1}{2}$
profit of firm 1 = $(p-MC)q_1=\dfrac{11-q_1}{2}q_1$
$q_1^s=5.5$
profit of firm 1 = 15.125

#### (3)
as long as monopoly profit >= 15.125, firm 1 will try to deter firm 2
$(p-MC)Q=(11-Q)Q\geq 15.125$
$Q^2-11Q+15.125\leq 0$
$q_1\leq 9.389$

E = profit of firm 2 = $(p-MC_2)q_2=\dfrac{11-q_1}{2}\dfrac{11-q_1}{2}$
at $q_1=9.389$, profit of firm 2 = 0.649
at $q_1=5.5$, profit of firm 2 = 7.5625
$E = [0.649, 7.5625]$

#### (4)
$q_1=11-2\sqrt{E}$

$q_1$ vs. E
![](https://i.imgur.com/1g8B9a5.png)

the curve fits when $5.5\leq q_1\leq 9.389$
$q_1 = 5.5$, otherwise

not an inversed-U shape tho

### Honest Tea
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V17RYNfwIZ0>

- tea with tiny amount of honey/cane sugar
- pros
	- healthy
		- lower calories than other bottled tea and other beverages
	- tasteful
		- more tasteful than water
	- affordable
- competitors
	- TeJava
		- unsweetened
		- Honest tea is more flavorful
	- Malibu Teaz
		- different target customer
	- The Republic of Tea
		- Honest tea is more affordable 
	- Tazo
		- Honest tea is healthier
		- Honest tea targets at wider audience
		- Honest tea is more affordable

![](https://i.imgur.com/VQmJwX9.png)

#### (1)
By "the optimal amount of sugar in bottled tea", it means the profit maximization amount of sugar. The optimal amount of sugar by profit is less than that by taste is because, while reducing a little amount fo sugar (from the point of optimal taste), the reduction of taste is minimal, but the cost reduction is significant enough to shift the profit maximization amount of sugar toward the lower end. 

It does make sense because consumers have a wide variety of taste, and are generally not that sensitive to taste, so the sells might not necessarily be affected by reducing a little taste, but the reduction of sugar used, would for sure result in lower cost. Therefor, a better profit can be achieved.

#### (2)
- targeting customers wanting something between water and soft drink
- those who wants cheap, healthy and tasteful beverage

#### (3)
Yes, because at the start, they exploit the unoccupied space of the market at that time, targeting those who wants healthy and not-to-sweet beverages. 

#### (4)
No. Established competitors can quickly roll out new products directly competing with it. Bigger brand can achieve the same quality with less cost, while reaching a bigger audience.

## HW5 Farmville strategy
[submission pdf](Industrial_Organization_Assignment__5.pdf)  
[submission tex](Industrial_Organization_Assignment__5.tex)

- utility of lands (if cultivated by a farmer)
	- fertile
		- produce $3 per period
	- meadow
		- produce $2 per period
	- rocky
		- produce $1 per period
- N teams
- farmer
	- can cultivate 0 or 1 land
	- if a farmer rent your land
		- you seizes the rent money
		- farmer seizes the production
	- get $0 per period when not renting any land
	- a farmer's utility = $max(0, production-rent)$
	- 超額比序 of lands：select the more productive one
- trade
	- landlords can freely trade lands with each other at any price
- bank
	- can get unlimited loan with no interest rate
- rules
	- in each period
		- landlords decide the lands they wants to rent out 
		- U(24, 40) farmers available
		- the price for each land is decided by the market competition
		- other period specific actions
	- at the start
		- each team get 24/N meadow lands & 24/N rocky lands
	- period 2-10
		- can trade the lands
	- period 6-10
		- can do 1 operation for each land each period (???), each operation costs $2
		- operations available
			- create a rocky land
			- rocky -> meadow
			- meadow -> fertile

![](https://i.imgur.com/tBqaXK0.png)

- strategies
	- always upgrade
		- can often times earn $1 more each period if upgrade
	- collude with other teams s.t. num of available lands < num of farmers
		- no incentive to deviate bc would worse off if lands > farmers

## HW6
4. Do initial conditions of the game matter? Initial conditions include the number of landlords and the initial allocation of lands in a market. When there are more landlords, would the expected value of lands increase or decrease? When land ownership becomes more concentrated, would the expected value of lands increase or decrease?
	- The initial conditions matter. When there are more landlords, it would be harder for landlords to collude and provide a monopolistic supply. The market would be more like competition, and the total land supply would be bigger, making the expected value of lands decrease.
	- On the contrary, when land ownership becomes more concentrated, collusion would be easier, decreasing the total land supply, thus increasing the expected value of land.
5. What’s the strategy you set before you start to play this game? Here your “strategy" means the big game plan you have in order to pursue your long-run goal, i.e., to maximize your cash over the 10 periods. Did your strategy work? In the middle of the game, did you ever change or revise your strategy?
	- Our main strategy was to try to communicate and collude with other teams to avoid oversupply, benefiting everyone, which proven to be quite successful (compared to another group) despite some obstacles.
	- Our secondary strategy is to buy or sell lands whenever we found the operation to be profitable, according the expected value of each type of land at each round we'd calculated. However, during the game, we found that our calculation was way too optimistic, as we didn't consider the fact that only the lands we decide to supply has value i.e. the lands we decide not to supply to avoid oversupply has zero value, so we almost never buy lands from others even when the price is lower than our previously calculated expected value. Instead, we actively sold our lands to others even when the price was lower than our previously calculated expected value.

## HW7
![](https://i.imgur.com/SX1S1o0.png)
- demand elasticity is probably very low
	- $1.39 is still really cheap compared to cost of going to a doctor (which will still not eliminate cold symptoms)
- assumptions
	- $1.39 is not the monopoly price
		- if it is, then shouldn't let the competitor in at all
	- demanded quantity is fixed to $Q = \dfrac{900M}{1.39-0.1} = 652.174M$
		- $(1.39-0.1)Q = 900M$
	- B (the new entry) has production MC = 0.1
	- at the same price, each firm would get half of the market
- without collusion, would enter competition after licensing
	- if charge a flat fee $700M
		- both will sell at P = MC = $0.1
		- A's profit = $0<900M$
		- B's profit = $-700M<0$
		- **both won't agree**
	- if charge a royalty fee $0.5 per dose
		- both will sell at $0.6 per dose
			- A sells at a bit lower than $
		- A's profit = $(0.6-0.1)Q<900M$
		- B's profit = $-700M<0$
		- **both won't agree**
	- worse off in both scenarios
- with collusion
	- fixing price to $1.39
		- if charge a flat fee $700M
			- assuming each gets half of the market
			- A's profit = $450M + 700M = 1150M > 900M$
			- B's profit = $450M - 700M = -250M < 0$
			- **B won't agree**
		- if charge a royalty fee $0.5 per dose
			- assuming each get half of the market
			- A's profit = $450M+(0.6-0.1)\dfrac{Q}{2}<900M$
			- B's profit = $(1.39-0.6)\dfrac{Q}{2}>0$
			- **A won't agree**
	- fixing price to $x
		- assuming demanded quality doesn't change
		- if charge a flat fee $700M
			- assuming each gets half of the market
			- A's profit = $(x-0.1)\dfrac{Q}{2} + 700M$
			- B's profit = $(x-0.1)\dfrac{Q}{2} - 700M$
				- $x\geq 2.247$ for B to agree
			- $x\geq 2.247$ for both to agree
				- A's profit $\geq 1400M$
				- B's profit $\geq 0$
		- if charge a royalty fee $0.5 per dose
			- assuming each get half of the market
			- A's profit = $(x-0.1)\dfrac{Q}{2}+(0.6-0.1)\dfrac{Q}{2}$
				- $x\geq 2.26$ for A to agree
			- B's profit = $(x-0.6)\dfrac{Q}{2}$
			- $x\geq 2.26$ for both to agree
				- A's profit $\geq 900M$
				- B's profit  $\geq 541.304M$
	- both has no incentive to deviate as that would lead to competition, resulting in extremely low profit
- result
	- charging a flat fee and colluding with B to fix price at at least $2.247 per dose would be the best strategy, under some assumptions
