## HW1
### Problem 1 - Monsanto's Roundup
![](https://i.imgur.com/6Avfj50.png)

#### (1)
- Conservation tillage gained popularity over time, and it needs a nonselective herbicide like Roundup. As conservation tillage is sensitive to the price of herbicides, cutting price would decently increase sales for Roundup.

#### (2)
- e = 22/(-9) = -2.44  
- max profit price = 26.55
	- MR = MC = P(1-1/e) = 45*(1-(1/2.44)) = 26.55 > 21 (international price)
- Monsanto did not set the right price

#### (3)
Before the patent expired, they got a monopoly of the product, and because there are no substitutes, the price elasticity should be low, making the cutting-price strategy uneffective.

Demand becomes more elastic in the long run.

- US e
	- 1995 = -9.21
	- 1996 = -2.33
	- 1997 = -2.5
	- 1998 = -2.79
	- 1999 = -1.17
	- 2000 = -1.04
- internation e
	- 1995 = -3.72
	- 1996 = -2.71
	- 1997 = -2.53
	- 1998 = -2.63
	- 1999 = -1.91
	- 2000 = -0.2

#### (5)
High market share, in turn, allowed Monsanto to exploit economies of scale
and work its way down the learning curve.

### Problem 2 - car

#### (1) 
the change of price of a car obviously affects the quantity of the car itself the most

#### (2)
sales of Taurus increases as price of Accord increases, so they're substitutes

#### (3)
Accord  
highest cross elasticity, meaning the substitute level is the highest

#### (4)
cross elasticity > 0  
-> Century's sells goes down when Cavalier's price decrease

#### (5)
- lower-end consumers are more price sensitive
- there are more competitors in the lower-end market

#### (6)
- Accord Q up about 9.3% = 27.9k
- Accord P down 2% -> Accord Q up 9.6%  
- Taurus P down 3% -> Accord Q down 0.3%  

### Water

#### (1)
bigger the total annual consumption, higher the elasticity
- essential consumptions are inelastic

#### (2)
rich
- rich households use more water than poor ones, yet pay the same

#### (3)
underestimated
- when facing a flat charge, the quantity of consumption does not affect the charge at all, meaning the marginal cost of using water is 0, so the calculated price elasticity would be very low

#### (4)
It should only be meaningful for people facing volume-based charge. For people facing flat charge, they would not reduce their water consumption at all.

### Durable Goods

#### (1)
- p1 = 450
- q1 = 400
- p2 = 150
- q2 = 300

#### (2)
- 225000
- 250000

#### (3)
賣一次
500, 250

#### (4)
sell once
