$\Delta R = (p+\Delta p)(q+\Delta q)-pq$
$MR=\dfrac{\Delta R}{\Delta q}=p(1-\dfrac{1}{|e|})$
e = elasticity not Euler's
$\dfrac{p-MC}{p}=\dfrac{1}{|e|}$

- Products with close substitutes have elastic demand.
- Demand for an individual brand is more elastic than industry aggregate demand.
- Products with less complements have more elastic demand.
- Demand becomes more elastic in the long run.
- As price increases, demand curves become more price elastic.
