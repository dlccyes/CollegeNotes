- $\Delta R = (p+\Delta p)(q+\Delta q)-pq$
- $MR=\dfrac{\Delta R}{\Delta q}=p(1-\dfrac{1}{|e|})$
- e = elasticity
- MR = MC
- $\dfrac{p-MC}{p}=\dfrac{1}{|e|}$
- elasticity of demand
	- Products with close substitutes have elastic demand.
	- Demand for an individual brand is more elastic than industry aggregate demand.
	- Products with less complements have more elastic demand.
	- Demand becomes more elastic in the long run.
	- As price increases, demand curves become more price elastic.
- markup = $\dfrac{P-C}{P}$
- market segmentation limit
	- cost of getting everyone's preference profile
	- hard to stop resale
