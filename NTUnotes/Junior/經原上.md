## law of demand
$pq = k$
- p = price
- q = quantity

## MP & MC
- marginal product MP
	- marginal product of labor $MP_L=\dfrac{dQ}{dL}$
- marginal cost $MC=\dfrac{dTC}{dQ}=\dfrac{d(FC+WL)}{dQ}=W\dfrac{dL}{dQ}=\dfrac{W}{MP_L}$ 
	- W = wage

## [[externality]]
- Pigouvian tax
	- tax on business creating negative externalities
- social benefit > private benefit → positive [[externality]]

## monopoly
- what is necessary for a social planner to restore efficiency in a monopoly?
	- monopolist's MC & demand curve
### monopolistic competition
- many firms offer products or services that are similar, but not perfect substitutes
- low barrier to join
- demand is highly elastic
	- 中油折 \$0.5→ 大家都跑來加中油
- economic profits
	- positive in short run
	- zero in long run
- price > MC

## miscellaneous
- in a competitive industry some firms can ears positive economic profits while some others earn 0 in the long run 
	- bc firms have different cost structures
- 可能影響 [[price elasticity]] 大小的因素
	- 替代品的多寡
	- 該商品佔消費支出比重
	- 反應時間長短
	- 物品耐用性
	- 商品定義範圍
- 請以 [[price elasticity]] 討論"穀賤傷農"背後的原因為何？
	- 稻米對消費者是必需品，[[price elasticity]] 較小，因此穀價下跌時，需求上升幅度並不高，導致農夫總收入降低
- production possibility curve
