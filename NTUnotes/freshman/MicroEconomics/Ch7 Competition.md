# Ch7 Competition

## 7.1 The Competitive Firm
marginal revenue = price
a firm's output: where price = MC (marginal cost)

### U-shaped MC curve

if lost in [0,Q<sub>1</sub>] < profit in [Q<sub>1</sub>,Q<sub>2</sub>] → produce Q<sub>2</sub>  
else → shut down

**short run**: can shutdown  
**long run**: can exit

### shut down or not ?
operate profit: TR(total revenue) - TC(total cost)  
shut down profit: -FC (fixed cost)  
TC = FC + VC (variable cost)  
operate if operate profit > shut down profit i.e. TR > VC  
(bc fixed cost is there whether shut down or not, so only variable cost matters)  
TR = P×Q > VC  
→ ==P > AVC== then a firm operate

bold part = supply curve  
(only produce when P=MC>AVC)

produce nothing at price < P<sub>0</sub>

### elasticity of supply
<!-- elasticity = $$\frac{\frac{△Q}{Q}}{\frac{△P}{P}}$$ -->
elasticity = $$\frac{△Q/Q}{△P/P}$$
(the flatter the higher)
<!-- $$(1+3)/3$$
\\\[display\\\]
\[70/2\]
<!-- $x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2b}.$
$$\frac{3}{4}$$ -->

## 7.2 The Competitive Industry in the Short Run

### changes in variable costs
![](https://i.imgur.com/NbGg2Ty.png)
a frim:  
- marginal cost rises → supply curve shifts upward/leftward
- in industry, price = P<sub>0</sub> → P<sub>2</sub>, so d→d' in a firm, q<sub>2</sub> not necessarily < q<sub>0</sub>  

an industry:  
- the sum of firms' supply curves → shifts upward/leftward  
- Q<sub>2</sub> < Q<sub>0</sub>

### a change in demand

## 7.3 The Competitive Firm in the Long Run
P<sub>0</sub>→P<sub>1</sub>
short run: S  
long run: LRS, S'

## 7.4 The Competitive Industry in Long Run

changes in variable cost
![](https://i.imgur.com/VmEEeOS.png)
如果每單位 output 上升相同的 marginal cost，AC 就會垂直上升，讓均衡 output 不變  
但若是 variable cost 按比例上升，output 愈大 marginal cost 上升愈多

### a rise in fixed cost

短期才會有好處
長期而言都是 0 profit

### applications
1. apartment rent for $400
2. new law: $200 max
3. change to $20p
4. remove law
5. change to $500
6. change back to $400 ultimately

## 7.5 XXXX-Cost Industries

### Constant-Cost Industries

break-even price (price the makes you profit = 0 ) is constant as q ↑

### Increasing-Cost Industries

break-even price ↑ as q ↑

可能原因

- break-even price 較低者較早進入市場，較高者較晚進入
- factor price ↑ as q ↑ e.g. lands

### Decreasing-Cost industries

costs ↓ as q ↑ → break-even price ↓ as q ↑ e.g. 3C industry
