A small VsCode basically

A very huge dealbreaker is that in the free version, **everything is public**

### Kaggle (for Python)

Minimal interface and kind of poor UX but 30 some hours of free GPU usage each week

Suitable for training ML models

### JSFiddle (for frontend)

HTML + CSS + JS with lots of JS libraries

Easy to share

## Helpers

### ChatGPT

Always ask ChatGPT before bothering your friends

### Character.AI

Not as good as ChatGPT generally but still helpful

Autocomplete on steroids, right inside your VsCode

You can get it for free for 1 year as a student (2022)

### SonarQube

See [[SonarQube]]

Forcing you to write good code.

Setting up the whole SonarQube is a bit of a hassle, but you can also just install SonarLint in VsCode

### DevDocs

<https://devdocs.io/>

- combine docs of all popular languages / libraries / frameworks
- can select what docs to enable
- good searching
