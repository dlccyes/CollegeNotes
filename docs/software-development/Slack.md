# Slack

## Great integrations

Called "Apps" in Slack. Need to be added to your target channels to work.

### Jira

Notify you when having new issues.

### Github

Notify you when having commits, Github action workflows run, new issues, etc.

## troubleshooting

### no notification sound

Preferences -> Notifications -> Sound & appearance -> click "Show an Example"  

if no sound

(on Mac)

- System Preferences -> Notifications & Focus -> Slack -> make sure "Allow Notifications" is checked
- System Preferences -> Sound -> make sure "Play user interface sound effects" is checked

### unread red dot always there

`Shift+Esc` -> clear all unreads
