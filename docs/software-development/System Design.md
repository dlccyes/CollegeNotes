## Scaling

### Vertical Scaling

- pros
	- fast inter-process communication
	- data consistent
- cons
	- single point of failure
	- hardware limit

### Horizontal Scaling

- pros
	- scale well
- cons
	- slow inter-process communication
		- need RPC between machines
	- need load-balancing
	- data inconsistency

## Performance

-  the performance of the 99.9th percentile is the most important
	- slow requests -> have many data -> valuable customer
	- Amazon:
		- + 100ms -> -1% revenue
		- + 1s -> -16% revenue
- service level agreements (SLAs)
	- service is up when 
		- median < 200ms
		- 99th < 1s
	- service needs to be up > 99.9% of the time
	- refund if not met

## Maintenability

- Operability
	- easy to operate
- Simplicity
	- easy to understand
- Evolvability
	- easy to make changes

### Operability

To make things easier to operate

- provide observability
- avoid single point of failure
	- -> no down time when updating a machine
- good documentation
	- finite state machine of all the things that may happen

### Simplicity

- complex -> bad operability & evolvability
- abstraction reduces accidental complexity
	- accidental complexity = complexity rising not from design but implementation
	- pros of abstraction
		- hides implementation details
		- can be reused
		- benefits all apps using it when improved
	- e.g. SQL

## Database

### One-to-Many Relationship

**Object-Relational Mismatch Problem**

Many real life data has **one-to-many** relationship e.g. a person may have several work experience, but relational tables aren't like that, so a translation layer between database model & application code is needed.

![[ddia-fig2-2.png]]

**Solutions**

- traditional SQL model: creating multiple tables with foreign keys to the common table
	- cons
		- bad locality: needs to perform multiple queries or multi-way join to get all data
	- ![[ddia-fig2-1.png]]
- later SQL versions
	- use JSON datatype
	- pros
		- good locality
			- everything in one place
			- only need one query
- encode those as JSON and store as text
	- cons
		- can't query the keys in the text json

### Many-to-One & Many-to-Many Relationship

**Problems of document model**

> Data has a tendency of becoming more interconnected as features are added to applications.

Many tree-like one-to-many data actually become graph-like many-to-many relationship when scaling and adding new features. 

e.g. a person has 2 schools in his profile page, but the schools should also have the person in their profile page

Document databases e.g. MongoDB, which excel at tree-like structures, have weak or no support for joins as one-to-many relationships don't need joins. This makes them not suitable for many-to-many relationships.

![[ddia-fig2-4.png]]

**Problems of network model**

Network model stores hierarchical as a graph. Each record can have multiple parents.

To query or update a record, the application code has to go through the graph from the root, making it complicated and inflexible.

**Relational model the solution**

- query optimizer does the heavy-lifting, not the application code
- declare a new index to query data in a new way
	- query optimizer will automatically choose the best index

### ACID

The 4 properties that define a **transaction**.

- atomicity
- consistency
- isolation
	- transactions are isolated to each other
- durability

Typically a trait of RDBMS, while NoSQL DBs typically don't support it.

### CAP

Only 2 of the 3 can be satisfied at the same time for any **distributed** data store. 

- Consistency
	- the read value is always the most recent
- Availability
	- you can read whenever you want
- Partition tolerance
	- the must in a distributed data store

Partition tolerance is a must, so the choice is between consistent & availability. Typically, RDBMS chooses consistency over availability, while NoSQL chooses availability over consistency.

### Primary Key

- uuid (universally unique identifier)
	- how to generate
		- timestamp
		- random
	- pros
		- unique
		- stateless
	- cons
		- not intrinsically sortable
		- performance issue for MySQL
- integer
	- how to generate
		- auto increment
	- pros
		- readable
	- cons
		- not unique across distributed systems
		- stateful
			- neet to consult db to know the next integer

### Index

- lookup time with [[CS 411 Database Systems#B + Tree|B Tree]] is $O(\log n)$

### Handling Hierarchical Data

If your data is a tree-like structure (undirected graph), you can design your db schema in multiple ways.

#### Multiple Tables

Use multiple tables with each non-root table having a foreign key referencing to the parent.

**Analysis**

- pros
	- ?
- cons
	- may have multiple tables storing the same kinds of information
		- e.g. managers & SWEs are all employees

#### Adjacency List

Have a column recording to the parents. 

**Minimal schema example**

- id
- parent_id

See [[SQL#Recursive Queries]] for quering a subtree

**Analysis**

- pros
	- simple
- cons
	- need recursive queries to get a subtree, slow in deep trees

#### Nested Sets

A segment tree. Record left & right values in a row.

**Example table**

id | name            | left  | right
---|------------------|------|------
 1 | Electronics      |   1  |  12
 2 | Cell Phones      |   2  |   7
 3 | Smartphones      |   3  |   4
 4 | Basic Phones     |   5  |   6
 5 | Computers        |   8  |  11
 6 | Laptops          |   9  |  10
 7 | Desktops         |   8  |   9
 8 | TV & Home Theater|  11  |  12
 9 | Books            |  13  |  18
10 | Fiction          |  14  |  15
11 | Non-Fiction      |  16  |  17
12 | Music            |  19  |  20

Exclusively use `left` & `right` to do queries (i.e. `id` isn't involved when quering)

**Analysis**

- pros
	- faster to query a deep subtree
- cons
	- need to update the `left` & `right` fields of many records when inserting or moving a node

#### Lineage Column / Path Enumeration / Materialized Path

Store the path in a field.

**Example table**

id | name            | path
--|--|--
 1 | Electronics      |   1
 2 | Cell Phones      |   1/2
 3 | Smartphones      |   1/2/3
 4 | Basic Phones     |   1/2/4
 5 | Computers        |   1/5
 6 | Laptops          |   1/5/6
 7 | Desktops         |   1/5/7
 8 | TV & Home Theater|   1/8
 9 | Books            |   9
10 | Fiction          |   9/10
11 | Non-Fiction      |   9/11
12 | Music            |   12

**Analysis**

- pros
	- very easy to query a subtree
		- e.g. `LIKE '1/2/%'`
- cons
	- very complex to move a node
		- need to update the path of itself and all its children
	- no referential integrity

#### Closure Table / Bridge Table

Have a dedicated table recording the relationship.

**Example relationship table**

For 1 -> 2 -> 3

ancestor_id | node_id
--|--
 1 | 1
 1 | 2
 1 | 3
 2 | 2
 2 | 3
 3 | 3

(omitting primary key)

**Analysis**

- pros
	- easy to select a subtree
- cons
	- complex to move a node
	- relationship table $O(n^2)$ space worst case

### Federation

- split db by functions
- similar pros & cons to [[#Sharding]]
- pros
    - less traffic for each db
    - smaller db -> more fit into memory -> less cache misses
    - can write to different dbs in parallel
- cons
    - joining data from 2 dbs is complex

### Denormalization

- normalization reduced data duplication, while denormalization increases it
- good for read-heavy applications
- pros
    - reduce needs of complex joins
        - especially if data is distributed with [[#Federation]] or [[#Sharding]]
- cons
    - duplicated data
    - expensive writes
    - more complicated to enure that redundant copies of data is consistent

## NoSQL

Some nice properties

- horizontal scaling
- redundancy
	- replicas
- data don't get removed instantly
	- can undelete


### BASE

properties of [[#NoSQL]]

- Basically Available
    - guarantees availability
- Soft state
    - the state of the system may change over time even without input
- Eventual consistency

### Wide Column Store

![[Pasted image 20240823064002.png]]

- good for
    - time series data
    - large scale data
    - write-heavy scenario
    - e.g. logging & real time analytics
- e.g. HBase & Casandra

## Replication

### Leader-Based Replication

- 1 replica leader/master, others followers/slaves
- client only writes to leader, changes later replicated to followers (sync or async)
- followers are read-only to client
- built-in for relational databases & message queues of high availability (e.g. Kafka & RabbitMQ)

#### replication methods

- sync
	- leader wait for response
	- -> high durability
- async
	- leader don't wait for response
	- -> high avaibility

Leader-Based Replication often uses async replication

#### adding a new follower

1. set up a follower node with a snapshot of the leader
2. sync with the leader with leader's log 

## Load Balancing

request id -> hashed request id -> mod by n (# of servers) -> direct to the server

### load balancer features

- distribute loads across backend servers
- SSL termination
    - decrypt requests & encrypt responses s.t. backend servers don't need to do it
- can act as a reverse proxy

### load balancing layers

- layer 4 - transport layer
    - distribute loads based on ip address
    - faster & less computation needed
- layer 7 - applicaton layer
    - distribute loads based on contents

### Cost of adding new servers

New servers -> some requests will be directed to a different server -> cache miss

### Consistency Hashing

Goal: Minimize the cost when adding new servers, we want to as few mapping changed as possible.

Key concept: Randomly assign servers to a position in an arbitrary circle, and each of them serve the requests closest to them (in the counterclockwise direction)

Each object's location = hashed key mod # seats in the ring

## Sharding

Partitioning/splitting the database accross nodes/servers.

- pros
    - lower traffic per server
    - failure more localized
    - less data in a server -> more data in cache -> less cache misses
- cons
    - complicated joins across different shards

### Vertical Partitioning

- partition by different features
	- e.g. profiles, messages, connections, etc.
- cons
	- table can still be large -> need repartition

### Key/Hash-Based Partitioning

- N servers -> mod by N
- cons
	- add servers -> need reallocate all the data -> very expensive

### Directory-Based Partitioning

- maintain a lookup table
- pros
	- easy to add servers
- cons
	- lookup table -> single point of failure
	- constantly access lookup table -> impact performance

### Problems

- join is expensive
	- if the target data are located in different shards, than we need to join multiple queries, which is expensive
- fixed number of shards
	- solution: [[#Consistency Hashing]]
		- memcached
	- solution: hierarchical sharding
		- each shard partitioned into many mini-shards

## Distributed DB System

### Master-Slave Architecture

- Write to master -> replicate data to slave
- Read from either of the master or slaves
- Master dies -> elect a new master among the slaves
- e.g.
	- DynamoDB

### Peer to Peer Architecture

- e.g.
	- Cassandra

## Caching

- See [[Computer Architecture#cache]]

### Advantages of caching

- reduce network calls
- reduce repetitive calculations
- reduce DB load

### In-memory cache vs. global cache

tradeoff: speed vs. accuracy

- in-memory cache
	- fast
	- data inconsistency across multiple caches
- global cache
	- slower
	- all clients access the same global cache so no data inconsistency problem

### Data syncing policy

tradeoff: performance vs. accuracy

- cache aside
    - cache miss -> application fetch data from db -> application write to cache
- read-through
    - cache miss -> cache fetch data from db -> write to cache
    - application doesn't communicate with db directly
- refresh-ahead
    - when cache entry is fetched, fetch latest data from db if close to expiration
    - performance depends on prediction accuracy
- write-through
	- write to cache -> write to db, SYNCHRONOUSLY
	- reduce cache miss
	- problem: data inconsistency across multiple caches
- write-behind/write-back
	- write to cache -> write to db, ASYNCHRONOUSLY
		- with a queue
- hybrid
	- uncritical data -> write-through
	- critical data -> write-back

## Microservices vs. Monolith

You probably don't need to use microservices.

[Microservice Story - A collection of technical blog ahout microservice & monolith](https://www.microservice-stories.com/)

### Bad microservices design examples

[Scaling up the Prime Video audio/video monitoring service and reducing costs by 90%](https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90)

[HackerNews dicussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35811741)

> This is not a discussion of monolith vs serverless. This is some terrible engineering all over that was "fixed". - [LASR](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=LASR)

## Async

- slow operations should be done asyncly
- pre-process
	- have the thing ready before user access if being out-of-date is acceptable

### Message Queues

### Back Pressure

- stop accepting requests when queue is full
- can be used with [[Computer Networks#exponential backoff|exponential backoff]]

## Networking Metrics

- bandwidth
	- max throughput
- throughput
- latency

## MapReduce

- to process large amounts of data in parallel
- map: label
	- input: raw data
	- output: (key, value)
- reduceL aggregate and organize
	- input: many (key, value)
	- output: (key, value)
- e.g.
	- ![[sys-des-mr-1.jpg]]
	- ![[sys-des-mr-2.png]]

## Storing passwords in the database

- db entry
	- hash(password + salt)
	- salt
- register flow
	- randomly generate a salt -> combine with user entered password -> hash -> store hashing result & salt into database
- auth flow
	- retrieve user's salt from db -> combine with entered password -> hash -> compare with db entry
- ref

## Case Study

### template

- requirements
    - expected traffic
    - consistency vs. availability
        - do we need ACID or just eventual consistency
        - do we need high availability
    - acceptable latency
    - read-to-write ratio
        - for a social network, users who don't react/post vs. users who do
    - content size
        - video platform - how long is the video?
- implementation
    - What kinds of data do we need to store? What's the best db for each? 
        - big files like image/video -> S3
    - if low latency is required, we can use a queue

### URL Shortening

[System Design Primer solution](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md)

- schema
    - link table
        - short link 7 chars -> 7B
            - is use bae62 -> $62^7$ = 3.5T unqiue urls
        - expired_at 5 chars -> 5B
        - created_at 5 chars -> 5B
        - original url 512 chars -> 512B
        - 530B for a record -> 5.3B for 10M records
    - user table
- database
    - selecting a db
        - since we don'e need relationships and are expecting high traffic, we can use a NoSQL db for the scalability & availability
    - scaling
        - [[#Sharding]]
- to generate unique urls
    - counter
        - complicated with horizontal scaling
    - random -> base62
        - may have collision
    - ip address + timestamp or the long url -> md5 -> base62
        - very low chance of collision
        - md5
        - base62
            - 26+26 english letters & 10 numbers
        - base64
            - base62 with `+` & `/`
            - not suitable for a url
    - a dedicated key generation service
        - generate keys and store in db
        - when we need a new url just fetch a generated one from db
        - pros
            - fast
            - don't need to worry about collisions
        - cons
            - complexity for dealing with concurrency
                - e.g. 2 servers trying to fetch the same key
            - single point of failure, or additional complexity of [[#replication]]

### Twitter Timeline

source: DDIA

**Approach 1**

- write: post a tweet -> insert into global tweets
	- simple
- read: sql join query to select tweets from those who the user follows
	- complex

Suitable for 

**Approach 2**

- write: post a tweet -> insert into the cache of each of the tweeter's followers
	- complex
- read: fetch the cache
	- simple

Suitable when # read reqs >> # write reqs

**Hybrid**

Approach 2 for tweets from the mass with little followers, and approach 1 for tweets from celebs

i.e. Tweets from celebs are indepedently fetched and then inserted into users' timeline cache
