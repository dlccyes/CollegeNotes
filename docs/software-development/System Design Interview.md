- clarify requirements
    - features
    - expected traffic
    - consistency vs. availability
        - do we need ACID or just eventual consistency
        - do we need high availability
    - acceptable latency
    - read-to-write ratio
        - for a social network, users who don't react/post vs. users who do

- requirements
    - custom link?
    - private links?
    - update/delete by users?
    - traffic?
        - 100M new URLs a day -> 365B for 10 years
    - multiple short links for a long url? 
    - default expiration time?
    - remove long unused links?
    - telemetry/analytics?
- APIs
    - `POST /api/v1/shorten`
        - return short url
    - `GET /api/v1/<shortUrl>`
        - return long url for redirection
            - `301 redirect` - permant redirection, so subsequent requests to the short url will be redirected immediately without calling the short url service
            - `302 redirect` - temporary redirection, so subsequent requests to the short url will be still call the short url service
- schema
    - link table
        - short link 7 chars -> 7B
            - is use bae62 -> $62^7$ = 3.5T unqiue urls
        - expired_at 5 chars -> 5B
        - created_at 5 chars -> 5B
        - original url 512 chars -> 512B
        - 530B for a record -> 5.3B for 10M records
    - user table
- database
    - selecting a db
        - since we don'e need relationships and are expecting high traffic, we can use a NoSQL db for the scalability & availability
    - scaling
        - [[#Sharding]]
- to generate unique urls
    - counter
        - complicated with horizontal scaling
    - random -> base62
        - may have collision
    - ip address + timestamp or the long url -> md5 -> base62
        - very low chance of collision
            - check if collision exists with bloom filter
        - md5
        - base62
            - 26+26 english letters & 10 numbers
            - make a number into 62-based
        - base64
            - base62 with `+` & `/`
            - not suitable for a url
    - a dedicated key generation service & db
        - [[System Design#Unique ID Generator]]
        - generate keys and store in key db
        - when we need a new url just fetch a generated one from db
        - pros
            - fast
            - don't need to worry about collisions
        - cons
            - complexity for dealing with concurrency
                - e.g. 2 servers trying to fetch the same key
            - single point of failure, or additional complexity of [[#replication]]
- expired links cleanup
    - options
        - on-demand
            - check expiration when accessed, if expired then delete and return error
        - cronjob to remove expired links
    - if using a key generation service & key db, recycle the key by putting it back to the db after link is deleted

## Web Crawler

![[sys-des-web-crawler.jpg]]

- usages
    - search engine indexing
    - web archiving
    - data mining
    - web monitoring
        - e.g. discover piracy
- requirements
    - purpose: search engine indexing
    - traffic: 1B we pages a month
    - HTML only
    - only consider newly added or edited web pages
    - store HTML up to 5 years
    - ignore duplicate content
    - characteristics
        - scalability
        - robustness
            - handle bad HTML, unresponsive servers, malicious links, etc.
        - politeness
            - reasonable request rate on a host
        - extensibility
            - flexible for new requirements
                - e.g. store image as well
- estimation
    - 1B per month -> 400 QPS
    - peak QPS = 400x2 = 800
    - assume average web page size 500KB
    - 50KB x 1B = 500TB of storage per month
    - 500TB x 12 x 5 = 30PB for 5 years

### design

- ![[sys-dis-web-crawler-high.png]]
- select seed URLs
    - select it based on
        - locality
        - topics
    - e.g. the seed URL of a university is its domain name
- URL frontier
    - a FIFO queue for URLs to be downloaded
    - BFS
    - ensure politeness - only download 1 page at a time from a host
        - map each host to a download thread
        - ![[sys-des-url-frontier.png]]
    - proiritizer - determine URL priority
        - use PageRank, traffic etc.
        - assign URLs into queues of different priorities
        - queues with higher priority would have a better change of being selected
        - ![[sys-es-webâ€“crwler-prioritizer.png]]
    - ensure freshness - keep updated
        - recrawl based on web pages' update history
        - recrawl important pages more frequently
- HTML downloader
    - download HTML
    - check `Robots.txt` (Robot Exclusion Protocol) to check pages allowed to be downloaded
        - cache it
- DNS Resolver
    - URL -> IP addres
- content parser
    - parse HTML
    - we need server-side rendering / dynamic rendering before parsing because many links are dynamically generated with JS
- content seen
    - 26% of web page are duplicated contents
    - compare hash values of 2 web pages
- content storage
    - most on disk
    - popular content in memory
- URL extractor
    - extract links from HTML
- URL filter
    - ignore some URLs based on content types, extensions, blacklist etc.
- URL seen
    - keep track of visited URLs
    - hash table or bloom filter
- URL storage
    - store visited URLs

### performance optimization

- distributed crawl
    - ![[sys-web-crawler-distributed-crawl.png]]
- cache DNS Resolver
    - DNS requests are often synchronous, so can be a bottleneck
    - cache the domain -> IP mapping, update periodically with cronjob
- locality
    - distribute crawl servers close to the hosts
- short timeout

### Robustness

- [[#Consistent Hashing]] for [[#Load Balancing]]
- save crawl states and data
    - restart a crawl by loading the states and data
- exception handling
- data validation
    - avoid spider traps
    - exclude noise

### Extensibility

We can easily add new features by plugging in new modules

![[sys-des-web-crawler-9.png]]

## Notification System

- requirements
    - notifications to support
        - push notification
        - SMS message
        - email
    - soft real time, accepting slight delay
    - supporting devices
        - iOS, andriod, laptop, desktop computer
    - trigger
        - client app
        - server-side
    - user can opt-out
    - traffic
        - 10M push notifications
        - 1M SMS
        - 5M emails

### types of notifications

- iOS push notification
    - provider builds and sends request to APNS (Apple Push Notification Service)
        - request contains device token & payload
- Android push notification
    - sends request to FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) instead of APNS
- SMS message
    - use 3rd party services e.g. Twilio, Nexmo
- email
    - use 3rd party services e.g. Mailchimp, SendGrid
    - or set up own email server

### gathering contact info

- save user contact info when the user first downloads the app or signs up
    - `user` table & `device` table
        - a user can have multiple devices
        - ![[sys-des-not-tables.png]]

### design

**initial version**

![[sys-des-not-des.png]]

- notification system
    - provide APIs to services
    - basic validations
    - build and send requests to third party notification services
- third-party services
    - note that some may be unavailable in some space and time

**scaled version**

![[sys-des-not-des-2.jpg]]

- notification servers
    - fetch data from cache or DB
    - push notification data to message queues
- cache
    - user info, device info, notification templates
- message queues
    - a message queue for each notification type
- workers
    - pull notification events from message queue, build the requests, and send to third-party service

### Reliability

- cannot have data loss
- retry if failed
    - worker fails to send -> put back to message queue
- to prevent duplicates, check event ID first and ignore already processed ones

### additional considerations

- notification template
    - many notifications follow a similar format
    - use preformatted notification template with customizable parameters to avoid building every notification from scratch
    - improve consistency & efficiency
- notification setting
    - respect users' notification settings
    - `(user_id bigInt, channel varchar, opt_in boolean)`
    - check if user is opted in for this notification type (channel) before sending
- rate limiting
    - limit the number of notifications a user can receive
- security
    - our APIs requires authentication
- monitor message queues
    - if too many in the queue, add more workers
- events tracking
    - tracking open rate, click rate, and engagement for notifications sent

![[sys-des-not-44.png]]

## News Feed

alt: Twitter Timeline

### requirements

- both mobile & web
- features
    - publish a post
    - see followers' posts
- sorting
    - by reverse chronological order
- friends limit
    - 5k a user
- traffic
    - 10M DAU (daily active users)
- types
    - text, images, and videos

### APIs

- publish API
    - `POST /v1/me/feed`
    - params
        - `content`
        - `auth_token`
- retrieve API
    - `GET /v1/me/feed`
    - params
        - `auth_token`

### Design

**publishing a post**

high level

![[sys-des-newsfeed-design.png]]

detailed

![[sys-des-newsfeed-design-deep.jpg]]

- web servers
    - enforce authentication & rate-limiting
-  fanout service
    - for building news feed
- notification service
    - send notifications to followers

**building newsfeed**

high level

![[sys-des-newsfeed-des-high.png]]

detailed

![[sys-des-newsfeed-retrieve-deep.jpg]]

- news feed service
    - fetch post IDs & user IDs from news feed cache
    - fetch post & user details from post & user cache
    - construct news feed and return
- cache
    - ![[sys-des-newsfeed-cache.png]]

### Fanout Service

**Fanout Approaches**

- fanout on write (push)
    - publish a post -> insert into the cache of each of the follower's cache (build news feed)
    - pros
        - fetching news feed (read) is fast
    - cons
        - hotkey problem: if the user has a lot of followers, fetching followers list and building news feed for all is time consuming
        - resource wasting to build news feed for inactive followers
- fanout on read (pull)
    - build news feed on read (on-demand)
    - pros
        - on-demand so won't waste resource on inactive users
    - cons
        - slow to fetch news feed
            - may need complex join
- hybrid
    - use push for normal users, pull for celebrities
    - read -> fetch the prebuilt news feed and pull contents from celebrities

**Fanout Flow**

![[sys-des-newsfeed-fanout-design.jpg]]

1. fetch follower IDs from graph db
2. fetch followers info from user cache, and filter out muted ones (or those the user doesn't wish to share this post with)
3. send followers list & new post ID to message queue
4. fanout workers fetch data from message queue
5. insert news feed data `(post_id, user_id)` to news feed cache
    - store only IDs to prevent large memory consumption
    - won't have cache miss unless user scroll through thousands of posts 

## Chat System

### requirements

- type: 1v1 & group chat
- platform: mobile & web
- traffic: 50M DAU
- group member limit: 100
- features
    - 1v1 chat
    - group chat
    - online indicator
    - only text
- message limit: 100k characters
- no end-to-end encryption
- chat history: forever

### communication protocol

- polling
    - client periodically asks server if there's message
    - cons
        - costly
        - resource wasting
- long polling
    - client sends a long polling request -> server holds the connection open until there's a new update -> server responds with the update and the connection is closed (customary for HTTP) -> client sends a new long polling request
        - if server timeout and close the connections, client will immediately sends a new long polling request as well
    - cons
        - if using load balancing the server receiving a message from the sender may not have the long polling connection with the intended receiver
        - server doesn't know if the client is still there
        - still inefficient
- websocket
    - bi-directional
    - persistent (unlike HTTP)
    - use websocket for both sender - server & server - receiver
    - the most used

### design

![[sys-des-chat-design-sv.jpg]]

- chat service is stateful because each client has a persistent websocket with a chat server
- use 3rd party service for push notification

![[sys-des-chat-design.png]]

- chat servers
    - send/receive messages
- presence servers
    - online/offline status
- API servers
    - login, signup, profile settings, etc.
- notifications servers
- key-value stores
    - chat history

### data storage

- user data in RDBMS
    - use [[#Replication]] ([[#Leader-Based Replication]]) & [[#Sharding]] to satisfy availability & scalability
- chat history in [[#Key-Value Store]]
    - requirements
        - chat data is enormous
        - only recent chats are accessed frequently
        - support searching (random access of data)
        - read-to-write ratio about 1:1
    - why [[#Key-Value Store]]
        - horizontal scaling
        - low latency
        - RDBMS doesn't handle long tail of data well, random access is expensive once index grows large
        - used by other chat systems 
            - e.g. Facebook Messenger users HBase, Discord uses Cassandra
    - 1v1 chat schema
        - ![[sys-des-chat-design-chat-schema.png]]
        - use `message_id` to decide message order because `created_at` may collide
    - group chat schema
        - ![[sys-des-chat-design-group-schema.png]]
        - composite pk of `(channel_id, message_id)`
        - use `channel_id` (group id) as the partition key
    - `message_id` generation
        - see [[#Unique ID Generator]]
        - properties
            - unique
            - newer one has bigger value
        - approaches
            - [[#Snowflake (Twitter)]]
            - local auto increment within a group

### deep dive

- service discovery
    - find the best chat server for a client
        - based on location, capacity, etc.
    - e.g. Apache Zookeeper
- 1v1 message flow
    - ![[sys-des-chat-1v1-msg-flow.png]]
    - flow
        1. user A sends a message to chat server 1 with websocket
        2. chat server 1 obtains a message ID from the ID generator
        3. chat server sends the message to the message queue
        4. message stored in key-value store
        5. if user B is online, sends the message to its server, chat server 2
        6. if user B is offline, push notification servers send a push notification to user B
        7. chat server 2 sends the message to user B with websocket
- message sync across devices for the same user
    - ![[sys-des-chat-msg-sync-flow.png]]
    - each device has a websocket to the same server
    - each device maintains the last message id on the device
    - if the incoming message's id is bigger, it's a new message
- small group chat message flow
    - ![[sys-des-chat-sgroup-msg-flow.png]]
    - ![[sys-des-chat-sgroup-msg-flow-2.png]]
    - new message is sent to the message queue of every other group members
    - becomes expensive once group is large
- online presence
    - websocket between client & presence server 
    - login/logout -> presence server saves status & timestamp to key-value store
    - disconnection
        - client sends heartbeat to presence server periodically
        - timeout -> mark as offline
    - fanout
        - ![[sys-des-chat-presense-fanout.png]]
        - when online status change, publish even to the channel for each group member
            - websocket
        - expensive for large group
            - use on-demand fetch instead

### extension

- media files
    - compression, cloud storage, thumbnails
- end-to-end encryption
- client-side caching
- message resent

## Search Autocomplete System

- requirements
    - position: only at beginning
    - suggestions to return: 5
    - ordering: historical query frequency
    - spell check?
        - no spell check or autocorrect
- estimation
    - 10M DAU
    - average 10 searches each person
    - 20B per query (5char x 4w)
    - 20 requests per query (each char input results in a query)
    - 10M x 10 x 20 = 2B queries a day = 24k QPS
    - peak QPS = 24k x 2 = 48k
    - assume 20% queries are new -> 10M x 10 x 20B x 20% = 400MB new data added to storage daily

### Small Scale Design

- data gathering service
    - gather user input and aggregate in real time
    - store as a frequency table `(query, search frequency)`
- query service
    - return most frequently searched terms from a prefix
    - use [[SQL]] `LIKE prefix% ORDER BY frequency`
        - inefficient in big scale

### Scalable Design

- trie
    - add frequency info into a regular trie
    - ![[sys-des-google-trie.png]]
    - $O(p+c\log c)$ time to get top k most searched queries from a prefix 
        - $p$ = length of prefix
        - $c$ = num of the decendents / subtree nodes of the prefix
        - $O(p)$ to traverse the prefix
        - $O(c)$ to get all the subtree nodes and their frequency
        - $O(c\log c)$ to sort by frequency and get the top $k$
            - you can probably do it in $O(k\log k)$ with a heap tho
        - ![[sys-des-google-trie-ex.png]]
    - $O(1)$ read time with optimizations
        - set prefix max length
            - set as a small constant like 50 -> reduce $O(p)$ to $O(1)$
        - cache top search querie at each node
            - trading space for time
            - ![[sys-des-google-trie-cache.jpg]]
            - $O(1)$ to retrieve top k in subtree if cache hit
- data gathering service
    - update trie in real time is impractical
        - high latency if traffic is high
        - top k may not change much over time, so it's inefficient to update trie frequently
    - how up to date depends on use case
        - Twitter requires up to date suggestions
        - Google not so much
    - ![[sys-des-google-trie-data-gat.png]]
    - analytics logs
        - `(query, timestamp)`
        - append-only
        - not indexed
    - aggregators
        - high aggregate frequency -> more up to date
        - aggregate logs into frequency table for each time period
        - `(query, frequency, timestamp)`
    - workers
        - build the trie from the aggregated data and save to trie DB periodically
        - async
    - trie cache
        - distributed cache for fast read
        - periodic snapshot of trie DB
    - trie DB
        - option - key-value store
            - hashmap representation of trie
        - option - document store
            - serialized periodic snapshot of trie
- query service
    - ![[sys-des-google-trie-query-svc.png]]
    - to optimize query speed
        - AJAX
        - browser caching
            - save autocomplete suggestions to browser cache with some TTL
        - data sampling
            - only log 1 out of $N$ request to save resource
- trie management
    - create/update from aggregated data
    - update
        - option - update trie directly
            - slow if big
        - option - build new trie periodically and replace old trie
    - delete bad suggestions
        - add a filter layer between API servers & trie cache
        - ![[sys-des-google-trie-filter.png]]
        - bad suggestions are removed from trie DB async as well
    - sharding 
        - shard the trie if too big
        - option - range-based
            - may have uneven distribution
        - option - shard map
            - analyze historical data distribution
            - ![[sys-des-google-trie-shardmap.jpg]]

### extension

- multi-language support
    - use unicode for trie
- locality
    - build different tries for different countries, storing in CDNs
- trending search queries (real-time)

## YouTube

alt: TikTok

- requirements
    - features: upload & watch videos
    - clients: mobile apps, browsers, smart TV
    - traffic: 5M DAU
    - average daily time spent for a user: 30min.
    - a lot of international users
    - accept most video resolutions & formats
    - needs encryption
    - file size max: 1GB
    - can use public cloud
- estimation
    - 5M DAU
    - average video size 300MB
    - storage
        - 10% of users upload 1 video per day
        - storage needed 5M x 10% x 300MB = 150TB
    - CDN cost
        - users watch 5 videos a day on average
        - $0.02 per GB transferred
        - 5M x 5 x 0.3GB x $0.02 per GB = $150K per day

### design

See [[Computer Networks#video streaming]] also

![[sys-des-youtube-high.png]]

- CDN
    - store and stream videos to users
- API servers
    - handle everything except streaming video

### video streaming

- stream from closest CDN edge server
- streamin protocols (see [[Computer Networks#video streaming#streaming protocols]])
    - MPEG-DASH
    - Apple HLS
    - Microsoft Smooth Streaming
    - Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming

### video transcoding

- transcode into different bitrates for users with different bandwidths & network conditions
- transcode into different formats for compatibility
    - container
        - e.g. `.mp4` `.mov` `.avi`
    - codecs
        - compression/decompression algo
        - e.g. `H.264` `HEVC` `VP9`
- DAG (directed acyclic graph) model for transcoding pipelines
    - like a CICD pipeline
    - ![[sys-des-youtube-transcode-dag.png]]
    - tasks
        - inspection
            - validation
        - video encoding
            - into different resolutions / codecs / bitrates
        - adding thumbmail
            - user uploaded or system generated
        - adding watermark
- architecture
    - ![[sys-des-youtube-transcode-arch.png]]
    - preprocessor
        - split video
            - split into GOP (Group of Pictures) i.e. small chunks of frames
        - generate DAG
            - generate DAG pipeline from config files
        - cache data
            - cache GOPs & metadata
            - retry with cache when encoding fails
    - DAG scheduler
        - split DAG pipeline into stages of tasks and put them into task queue
        - ![[sys-des-youtube-dag-sch.jpg]]
    - resource manager
        - ![[sys-des-youtube-resource-m.jpg]]
        - task scheduler
            1. pick the most important task from task queue
            2. pick the best worker from worker priority queue
            3. dispatch the chosen task to the chosen worker
            4. put the task & worker into running queue
            5. remove the task & worker info from running queue when done
        - task queue
            - priority queue with TODO tasks
        - worker queue
            - priority queue with worker utilization info
        - running queue
            - info about currently running tasks & worker
    - task workers
        - run the assigned tasks
    - temporary storage
        - cache metadata in memory
            - frequently accessed my workers
            - small
        - put video & audio in blob storage
        - data removed once video done

### optimizations

- parallel video uploading
    - client splits video into GOPs / small chunks and upload in parallel
    - ![[sys-des-youtube-opt-split.png]]
- place upload server close to users
- async with message queues
    - ![[sys-des-youtube-async-mq.jpg]]
    - s.t. each module not dependent on each other, can execute tasks in parallel
- cost optimization from historical patterns
    - only cache popular videos on CDN
        - serve normal videos from video servers
        - Youtube videos have a long-tail distribution i.e. a lot of videos have almost no viewers
    - fewer versions encoded for non-popular videos  
    - short videos encoded on-demand
    - locality
        - no need to distribute regionally popular videos to the world
    - build your own CDN and partner with ISPs

### security

- presigned URL
    - ![[sys-des-youtube-presign.png]]
    - API servers give user a dedicated URL to upload to S3
    - called "Shared Access Signature" for Azure Blob Storage
- copyright protection
    - DRM (digital rights management) systems
        - e.g. Apple FairPlay, Google Widevne, Microsoft PlayReady
    - AES encryption
        - can authorized users can decrypt
    - visual watermark

### error handling

- recoverable error
    - retry a few times before returning proper error code
    - e.g. encode failures
- non-recoverable error
    - return proper error code
    - e.g. malformed video format
- common error handlings
    - upload error: retry
    - split video error
        - if old clients can't split videos, pass the entire video to server and split server-side
    - transcoding error: tretry
    - preprocessor error: regenerate DAG pipeline
    - DAG scheduler error: reschedule
    - resource manager queue down: use replica
    - task worker down: retry task on another worker
    - API server down: redirect request to another server
    - metadata cache server down: read from another
        - [[#Leaderless Replication]]
    - metadata DB server down
        - [[#Leader-Based Replication]]
        - leader down -> promote a follower to leader
        - follower down -> read from another

- functional requirements
    - features: upload, download, sync, notifications
    - platforms: mobile & web
    - file formats: all
    - encryption: files need to be encrypted
    - file size limit: 10GB
    - traffic: 10M DAU
- non-functional requirements
    - reliability: no data loss
    - latency: fast sync speed
    - bandwidth: low bandwidth used, especially for mobile users
    - scalability
    - availability: available when some servers down, slowed down, or have network errors
- estimation
    - 50M users, 10M DAU
    - each user has 10GB free space
    - average user upload 2 files a day
    - average file size 500KB
    - read-to-write 1:1
    - storage needed = 50M x 10GB = 500PB
    - upload QPS = 10M x 2 / 86400 = 240
    - peak QPS = 240 x 2 = 280

### simple design

- storage system
    - store files under `/drive`
- web server
    - upload API
        - simple upload
        - resumable upload
            - `POST /files/upload?uploadType=resumable`
    - download API
        - `GET /files/download`
        - params: `{"path": <download file path>}`
    - get file revisions API
        - `GET /files/list-revisions`
        - params: `{"path": <download file path>, "limit": 20}`
- metadata DB
    - user data, login info, files info, etc.

scaling

- load balancer with dynamic web servers
- metadata DB with replication & sharding
- file storage using S3
    - replication
        - same-regions
        - cross-region

![[sys-des-google-drive-simple-design.png]]

[[#Resolving conflicts]]: first-to-write wins, the later one receives a conflict, to be resolved manually by user

### scalable design

![[sys-des-gdrive-high-design.jpg]]

- block servers
    - split files into blocks and upload to cloud storage
    - compress & encrypt the blocks before uploading
    - each block has a hash value stored in metadata DB
    - recontruct a file by joining blocks
- cloud storage
- cold storage
    - store inactive files
- load balancer
- API servers
- metadata DB
    - metadata for users, files, blocks, versions, etc.
- metadata cache
- notification service
    - notify when a file is added/edited/removed
    - uses long polling
        - websocket also works but it's more suitable for bi-directional real-time communications
- offline backup queue
    - store and sync the changes when client is back online

### block servers

**flow**

![[sys-des-gdrive-block-server.png]]

**optimizations**

- delta sync
    - when a file is modified, only sync the modified blocks to cloud storage
    - ![[sys-des-gdrive-block-sync.png]]
- compression
    - each block is compressed
    - different compression algo for different file types
        - e.g. gzip & bzip2 for text files

**tradeoffs of skipping the block server** (client directly uploads to cloud storage)

- pros
    - faster as a files is only transferred once
- cons
    - compression & encryption need to be done in the client, which is platform-dependent
    - client-side encryption is not safe

### Metadata DB

- requires [[#strong consistency]]: every client sees the latest data
- use a relational database
- schema
    - ![[sys-des-gdrive-metadatadb-schema.jpg]]
    - user: user info
    - device: device info
    - workspace/namespace: root dir of a user
    - file: file into
    - file_version: version history of a file
        - rows are read-only
    - block: blocks of a file
        - construct a file of a version with the correct order

### upload flow

adding file metadata request & uploading file request sent & processed in parallel

![[sys-des-gdrive-upload-flow.png]]

### download flow

when a file is modified by another client, notification service notifies the client

![[sys-des-gdrive-download-flow.png]]

1. retrieves the changes from metadata DB
2. request the actual blocks from cloud storage
3. recontruct the file from the downloaded blocks

### handling file revisions

file revisions can easily take up tons of space, here are some strategies to save space

- no redundant blocks
    - blocks are identical if the hash value is the same
- file revision limit
    - replace oldest version with the latest version when limit reached
- keep valuable versions only
    - files can have a ton of revisions within a short period
- move inactive data to cold storage
    - e.g. Amazon S3 Glacier is much cheaper than S3

### handling failure

- load balancer failure
    - another load balancer picks up the traffic of a failed one
    - load balancers heartbeat each other
- block server failure
    - another server picks up the jobs of the failed one
- cloud storage failure
    - S3 buckets are replicated across regions
    - try another region if one region dies
- API server failure
    - load balancer redirect traffic to another 
- metadata DB failure
    - [[#Leader-Based Replication]]
- notification service failure
    - all the long polling connections of the failed server need to be reconnect to another server
- offline backup queue server
    - they're replicated
    - consumer of the failed leader queue resub to the newly promoted leader queue
