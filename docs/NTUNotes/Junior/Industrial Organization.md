# Industrial Organization

## Price Elasticity

- ![[industrial-organization-1.png]]
- $\Delta R = (p+\Delta p)(q+\Delta q)-pq$
- $MR=\dfrac{\Delta R}{\Delta q}=p(1-\dfrac{1}{|e|})$
- e = elasticity
- MR = MC
- $\dfrac{p-MC}{p}=\dfrac{1}{|e|}$
- elasticity of demand
	- Products with close substitutes have elastic demand.
	- Demand for an individual brand is more elastic than industry aggregate demand.
	- Products with less complements have more elastic demand.
	- Demand becomes more elastic in the long run.
	- As price increases, demand curves become more price elastic.
- markup = $\dfrac{P-C}{P}$
- market segmentation limit
	- cost of getting everyone's preference profile
	- hard to stop resale

## Oligopoly

see [Oligopoly](../Freshman/Microeconomics/Ch11%20Market%20Power,%20Colusion,%20and%20Obligopoly#oligopoly)

### Bertrand Model

- [Bertrand Model](../../obs_autolink/Bertrand%20Model)
- firms set price simultaneosly
- Nash equilibrium of duopoly is both setting competition price -> Bertrand paradox

### Cournot Model

- [Cournot Model](../../obs_autolink/Cournot%20Model)
- firms set output simultaneosly
- Nash equilibrium of duopoly
	- given $MC=c, P(Q)=a-bQ, a>c$
	- $q_1=q_2=\dfrac{a-c}{3b}, P=\dfrac{a+2c}{3}$
	- P & Q between monopoly & competition 
- Nash equilibrium of n firms
	- given $MC=c, P(Q)=a-bQ, a>c$
	- $q_1=q_2=\dfrac{a-c}{(n+1)b}, P=\dfrac{a+nc}{n+1}$
	- $n \rightarrow \infty$ -> competition

### example: linear city with differentiation

- a 1-unit long linear street with evenly distributed customers, and 2 firms at each end
- transportation cost per unit distance = t
- equilibrium price = MC+t
- transportation cost can be translated to product differentiation
- with product differentiation, products can sell above competition price even in Bertran model

## collusion

- market power = $\dfrac{p-MC}{p}$
	- how much is the firm able to sell above MC
- system profit in Bertrand competition < system profit of monopoly
- repeated game
	- infinite period
	- discount factor $\delta$ 
		- 1 in this period -> $\delta$ in next period

### Grim Trigger Strategy

- algo
	- initially both firms set p = monopoly price
	- if history price was always the monopoly price, set p = monopoly price
	- else set p = MC
- analysis
	- don't deviate -> share monopoly profit
	- deviate -> get all the profit this period
	- to deviate
		- ![[industrial-organization-2.png]]
		- ![[industrial-organization-3.png]]
		- $\delta \geq \dfrac{1}{2}$

## miscellaneous

- gross profit margin vs. operating profit margin
	- gross profit = revenue - direct cost of the products sold
	- operating profit = revenue - all cost
