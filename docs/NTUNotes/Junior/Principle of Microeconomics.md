## law of demand

$pq = k$

- p = price
- q = quantity

## labor market

- marginal product MP
	- marginal product of labor $MPL=\dfrac{dQ}{dL}$
		- wage = value of MPL, VMPL = (Price - non-labor cost per item) X MPL
- marginal cost $MC=\dfrac{dTC}{dQ}=\dfrac{d(FC+WL)}{dQ}=W\dfrac{dL}{dQ}=\dfrac{W}{MPL}$ 
	- W = wage
- labor demand
	- inelastic → min wage increase won't lead to big unemployment increase
		- high skill  or hard-to-replace workers → inelastic
		- strong labor union → inelastic
	-  elastic → min wage increase lead to big unemployment increase
		- easy-to-replace workers → elastic

## externality

- Pigouvian tax
	- use tax i.e. government power
- social benefit > private benefit → positive externality

## monopoly

- what is necessary for a social planner to restore efficiency in a monopoly?
	- monopolist's MC & demand curve
		- u can get MR from demand

### monopolistic competition

- many firms offer products or services that are similar, but not perfect substitutes
- low barrier to join
- heterogeneous good
- demand is highly elastic
	- 台灣之星 188 → 大家跑來搶
- economic profits
	- positive in short run
	- zero in long run
- price > MC

### Oligopoly

- 出現強烈削價競爭 → P=MC → efficient quantity

## price elasticity

- [[price elasticity]]
- midpoint method
	- significance: A→B & B→A 變動比率一樣 $\because$ 分母一樣
- positive
- \> 1 → elastic (quantity change faster than price)
- < 1 → inelastic (price change faster than quantity)

## miscellaneous

- in a competitive industry some firms can ears positive economic profits while some others earn 0 in the long run 
	- bc firms have different cost structures
- 可能影響 [[price elasticity]] 大小的因素
	- 替代品的多寡
	- 該商品佔消費支出比重
	- 反應時間長短
	- 物品耐用性
	- 商品定義範圍
- 請以 [[price elasticity]] 討論"穀賤傷農"背後的原因為何？
	- 稻米對消費者是必需品，[[price elasticity]] 較小，因此穀價下跌時，需求上升幅度並不高，導致農夫總收入降低

- The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is maximized at the equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market
- education
	- 人力資本理論
		- 學習提高人的生產力
	- signaling
		- 強者拿文憑的 cost 較低，弱者 cost 較高，若 cost 超過 expected revenue 則會放棄拿文憑
			- → 有文憑者 = 拿文憑所需 cost 較小者
- Condorcet: 群體 makes better decision than 個體
- increase in minimum wage on unemployment rate
	- [[price elasticity]]

- equity
	- Horizontal equity
		- people in the same circumstances should be treated in the same way
	- Vertical equity 
		- people on higher incomes should take on a greater share of the responsibility for paying for public services.
- wage
	- compensating differential
		- pay more for bad jobs
	- efficiency wage
		- pay more for more productivity
	- human capital
		- pay more for employee's information & skill (human capital)
- in long run, a competitive firm supply at price = min AC

- binding = 強制性

## 題目

- ![](https://i.imgur.com/A8R51mJ.png)
	- 舊款主要客群是對 demand 彈性較大者，so price reduction 不需太大就能達到顯著 quantity increase
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/BqzOFei.png)
	- 很多廠商 exit → market supply 下降 → market price i.e. short run price 上升 > min AC → firm earns positive economic profits → 廠商進駐，提高 market supply → market price 降低，直到 market price = firm's min AC → long run equilibrium
