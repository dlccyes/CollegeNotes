# Cooperative Service Caching and Workload Scheduling in Mobile Edge Computing

[pdf with my annotations](Cooperative_Service_Caching_and_Workload_Scheduling_in_Mobile_Edge_Computing.pdf)

## Introduction

- exploding mobile data
- cache service at edge node and process
- w/o cooperation, many edge resources are underutilized
	- storage & computation mismatch -> one of the two will be wasted
- cooperative service caching
	- offload computation to underutilized neighbor edge nodes
	- tradeoff
		- reduce computation delay
		- increase transmission delay
		- computation vs. communication
