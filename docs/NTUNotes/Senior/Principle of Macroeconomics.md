[Principles of Economics 9e, Mankiw.](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=E4F408FE98ABD6329394D2C9C9DE877F)

## Ch23 GDP

See [[Macroeconomics#Ch2 產出與物價的衡量]]

### GDP Deflator

See [[Macroeconomics#GDP 平減指數 (GDP Deflator)]]

GDP deflator = $\dfrac{\text{target year nominal GDP}}{\text{real GDP} = \text{base year prices}\times\text{target year quantities}}$

Will underestimate inflation

## Ch24 Cost of Living

### CPI

See [[Macroeconomics#消費者物價指數 (CPI, consumer price index)]]

CPI = $\dfrac{\text{target year prices}\times\text{base year quantities}}{\text{base year nominal GDP}}$

Will overestimate inflation

### Interest Rate

real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate

## Ch25 Production and Growth

### Production Function

$$Y=A\times f(L,K,H,N)$$

- $A$ = level of technology
	- technology development of the whole society
- $L$ = labor
- $K$ = physical capital
	- machines, equipments, structures, etc.
- $H$ = human capital
	- knowledge and skills of labor
- $N$ = natural resources

## Ch26 Saving, Investment, and the Financial System

### Savings

See [[Macroeconomics#支出面]]

$$Y = C + I + G + NX$$

- $Y$ = total expenditure = total income
- $C$ = consumption
- $I$ = investment
	- purchase of new capital
	- securities (e.g. stock & bonds) are not capital so not investment
- $G$ = government purchases
- $NX$ = net exports

$$S=Y-C-G=(Y-T-C)+(T-G)$$

- $S$ = national saving = private saving + public saving
- $Y-T-C$ = private saving
	- income - tax - consumption
- $T-G$ = public saving
	- tax revenue - government spending

### Loanable Funds Market

## Ch27 Risk

concave utility funcion -> risk averse

See this utility vs. wealth diagram, with the green line being the person's utility funciton.

![](https://i.imgur.com/522fdp3.png)

Any risk combination of 0 & 1 will have the final utility fall on the red line, whereas a certain holding of the same expected wealth will fall on the green line, which is always above the red line, meaning this person is risk averse.

## Ch30 Money Growth and Inflation

- price level $P$ = the price of a basket of goods
- value of money = $1/P$

### Velocity of Money

- price level $P$ = nominal GDP / real GDP
- velocity of money $V$ = nominal GDP / money supply

### Money Demand

higher price level -> lower value of money -> higher money demand

### Unexpected Inflation

Unexpected high inflation helps borrowers and harms loaners.
