## Ch23 GDP

### Nominal GDP

See [[Macroeconomics#Ch2 產出與物價的衡量]]

### GDP Deflator

See [[Macroeconomics#GDP 平減指數 (GDP Deflator)]]

GDP deflator = $\dfrac{\text{target year nominal GDP}}{\text{real GDP} = \text{base year prices}\times\text{target year quantities}}$

- uses base year prices
- will underestimate inflation

## Ch24 Cost of Living

### CPI

See [[Macroeconomics#消費者物價指數 (CPI, consumer price index)]]

CPI = $\dfrac{\text{target year basket price}}{\text{base year basket price}}$

- uses fixed quantities i.e. a basket of goods
- will overestimate inflation
	- price of good A rises -> consumption of A reduces, but the quantity of it in the basket doesn't change -> overestimate CPI changes
	- new goods introduced in the market -> more alternatives -> less consmption on original goods -> original goods' prices rise -> overstate cost of living
	- quality of goods increases -> price increases -> overstate cost of living

### Interest Rate

real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate

## Ch25 Production and Growth

### Production Function

$$Y=A\times f(L,K,H,N)$$

- $A$ = level of technology
	- technology development of the whole society
- $L$ = labor
- $K$ = physical capital
	- machines, equipments, structures, etc.
- $H$ = human capital
	- knowledge and skills of labor
- $N$ = natural resources
	- price natural resources are stable or falling
	- meaning technology improvement mitigates the depletion of natural resources

### Constant return to scale

If all inputs change by x%, then the output will also change by x%

### Things that help the economy

- education
- health and nutrition
- property rights
	- honoring contracts
- political stability
	- uncertainty for property rights
- free trade
	- countries disallowing free trade generally fail to grow
- population growth
	- market
	- technology progress

## Ch26 Saving, Investment, and the Financial System

See [[Macroeconomics#支出面]]

$$Y = C + I + G + NX$$

- $Y$ = total expenditure = total income
- $C$ = consumption
- $I$ = investment
	- purchase of new capital
	- securities (e.g. stock & bonds) are not capital so not investment
- $G$ = government purchases
- $NX$ = net exports

### Savings

$$S=Y-C-G=(Y-T-C)+(T-G)$$

- $S$ = national saving = private saving + public saving
- $Y-T-C$ = private saving
	- income - tax - consumption
- $T-G$ = public saving
	- tax revenue - government spending

### Loanable Funds Market

- supply = savings
- demand = investment

## Ch27 Finance 101

### Risk

concave utility funcion -> risk averse

$$u(E(X))>E(u(X))$$

See this utility vs. wealth diagram, with the green line being the person's utility funciton.

![](https://i.imgur.com/522fdp3.png)

$$u(a\cdot C^H+b\cdot C^L)>a\cdot u(C^H)+b\cdot u(C^L)$$

$$a+b=1$$

Any risk combination of 0 & 1 will have the final utility fall on the red line, whereas a certain holding of the same expected wealth will fall on the green line, which is always above the red line, meaning this person is risk averse.

### Efficient Markets Hypothesis

- asset price reflecs all publicly available information the value of the asset
- stock price is random

## Ch29 The Monetary System

### The Money Stock

About M1 & M2, see [[Ch3 貨幣與支付系統#貨幣總計數]]

![](https://i.imgur.com/2UKdoox.png)

### Bank Reserves

See [[Ch15 準備貨幣與貨幣的創造#15.4 存款貨幣的創造]]

money supply = money / reserve rate

Suppose total currency = $1 and reserve rate = R, and there is an infinite number of banks

A deposits 1 to bank A -> B borrows 1-R from bank A and deposits it to bank B -> C borrows (1-R)(1-R) from bank B and deposits it to bank C -> ... -> 1/R of deposits in the system

### Balance Sheet

leverage = assets / capital = assets / assets - liabilities

![](https://i.imgur.com/BIqY9RO.png)

### Fed

See also [[Ch16 傳統與非傳統的貨幣政策工具]]

- Open Market Operations
	- See [[Ch16 傳統與非傳統的貨幣政策工具#16.3 公開市場操作 open market operation]]
	- buy & sell government bonds to change money supply
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ku6WHXc.png)
- discount window
	- bank can borrow money from Fed's discount window
	- interest rate of discount window = discount rate
- set reserve rate
- set interest rate on reserves
	- higher -> more reserves -> lower money multiplier -> lower money supply
- set federal funds rate
	- interest rate of overnight loans from one bank to another

## Ch30 Money Growth and Inflation

- price level $P$ = the price of a basket of goods
- value of money = $1/P$

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZrGnxlv.png)

### Money Demand

higher price level -> lower value of money -> higher money demand

![](https://i.imgur.com/qDVWzhQ.png)

### Nominal & Real

- classical dichotomy: nominal doesn't affect real
- neutrality of money: money supply doesn't affect real

### Velocity of Money

- price level $P$ = nominal GDP / real GDP
- velocity of money $V$ = nominal GDP / money supply

![](https://i.imgur.com/Mo9bmrB.png)

**Quantity Theory of Money**

velocity of money is stable, money supply doesn't affect real GDP, so money supply growth = inflation

### Fisher

real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate

### Unexpected Inflation

Unexpected high inflation helps borrowers and harms loaners.
