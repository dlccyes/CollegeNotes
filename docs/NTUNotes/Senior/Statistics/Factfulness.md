## Straight Line Instinct

The slope of a line often changes instead of staying as a constant

## Generalization Instinct

Your own experience may not apply to other groups of people, especially those in different income levels

## Destiny Instinct

- people think A -> B, forever
- but cultures and values changes

## Single Perspective Instinct

> Give a child a hammer and everything looks like a nail.

Almost nothing is the only solution

## Blame Instinct

- we often think there's a main culprit for everything bad, but often times it's complicated
- the result is often from the system instead of an individual

## Size, Negativity, Fear, & Urgency Instinct

- selective reporting: bad things are reported but not good things
- things are often exaggerated or too negatively predicted
- worst-case scenario is very unlikely to happen
