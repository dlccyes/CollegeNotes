## Ch23 GDP

### Nominal GDP

See [[Macroeconomics#Ch2 產出與物價的衡量]]

### GDP Deflator

See [[Macroeconomics#GDP 平減指數 (GDP Deflator)]]

GDP deflator = $\dfrac{\text{target year nominal GDP}}{\text{real GDP} = \text{base year prices}\times\text{target year quantities}}$

- uses base year prices
- will underestimate inflation

## Ch24 Cost of Living

### CPI

See [[Macroeconomics#消費者物價指數 (CPI, consumer price index)]]

CPI = $\dfrac{\text{target year basket price}}{\text{base year basket price}}$

- uses fixed quantities i.e. a basket of goods
- will overestimate inflation
	- price of good A rises -> consumption of A reduces, but the quantity of it in the basket doesn't change -> overestimate CPI changes
	- new goods introduced in the market -> more alternatives -> less consmption on original goods -> original goods' prices rise -> overstate cost of living
	- quality of goods increases -> price increases -> overstate cost of living

### Interest Rate

real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate

## Ch25 Production and Growth

### Production Function

$$Y=A\times f(L,K,H,N)$$

- $A$ = level of technology
	- technology development of the whole society
- $L$ = labor
- $K$ = physical capital
	- machines, equipments, structures, etc.
- $H$ = human capital
	- knowledge and skills of labor
- $N$ = natural resources
	- price natural resources are stable or falling
	- meaning technology improvement mitigates the depletion of natural resources

### Constant return to scale

If all inputs change by x%, then the output will also change by x%

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-7.png]]

### Things that help the economy

- education
- health and nutrition
- property rights
	- honoring contracts
- political stability
	- uncertainty for property rights
- free trade
	- countries disallowing free trade generally fail to grow
- population growth
	- market
	- technology progress

## Ch26 Saving, Investment, and the Financial System

See [[Macroeconomics#支出面]]

$$Y = C + I + G + NX$$

- $Y$ = total expenditure = total income
- $C$ = consumption
- $I$ = investment
	- purchase of new capital
	- securities (e.g. stock & bonds) are not capital so not investment
- $G$ = government purchases
- $NX$ = net exports

### Savings

$$S=Y-C-G=(Y-T-C)+(T-G)$$

- $S$ = national saving = private saving + public saving
- $Y-T-C$ = private saving
	- income - tax - consumption
- $T-G$ = public saving
	- tax revenue - government spending

### Loanable Funds Market

- supply = savings
- demand = investment

## Ch27 Finance 101

### Risk

concave utility funcion -> risk averse

$$u(E(X))>E(u(X))$$

See this utility vs. wealth diagram, with the green line being the person's utility funciton.

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-9.png]]

$$u(a\cdot C^H+b\cdot C^L)>a\cdot u(C^H)+b\cdot u(C^L)$$

$$a+b=1$$

Any risk combination of 0 & 1 will have the final utility fall on the red line, whereas a certain holding of the same expected wealth will fall on the green line, which is always above the red line, meaning this person is risk averse.

See also [[Ch18 Risk and Uncertainty]]

### Efficient Markets Hypothesis

- asset price reflecs all publicly available information the value of the asset
- stock price is random

## Ch29 The Monetary System

### The Money Stock

About M1 & M2, see [[Ch3 貨幣與支付系統#貨幣總計數]]

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-10.png]]

### Bank Reserves

See [[Ch15 準備貨幣與貨幣的創造#15.4 存款貨幣的創造]]

money supply = money / reserve rate

Suppose total currency = $1 and reserve rate = R, and there is an infinite number of banks

A deposits 1 to bank A -> B borrows 1-R from bank A and deposits it to bank B -> C borrows (1-R)(1-R) from bank B and deposits it to bank C -> ... -> 1/R of deposits in the system

### Balance Sheet

leverage = assets / capital = assets / assets - liabilities

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-15.png]]

### Fed

See also [[Ch16 傳統與非傳統的貨幣政策工具]]

- Open Market Operations
	- See [[Ch16 傳統與非傳統的貨幣政策工具#16.3 公開市場操作 open market operation]]
	- buy & sell government bonds to change money supply
	- ![[principle-of-macroeconomics-16.png]]
- discount window
	- bank can borrow money from Fed's discount window
	- interest rate of discount window = discount rate
- set reserve rate
- set interest rate on reserves
	- higher -> more reserves -> lower money multiplier -> lower money supply
- set federal funds rate
	- interest rate of overnight loans from one bank to another

## Ch30 Money Growth and Inflation

- price level $P$ = the price of a basket of goods
- value of money = $1/P$

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-17.png]]

### Money Demand

higher price level -> lower value of money -> higher money demand

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-18.png]]

### Classical Economics Assumptions

- classical dichotomy: nominal doesn't affect real
- neutrality of money: money supply doesn't affect real

### Velocity of Money

- price level $P$ = nominal GDP / real GDP
- velocity of money $V$ = nominal GDP / money supply

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-19.png]]

**Quantity Theory of Money**

velocity of money is stable, money supply doesn't affect real GDP, so money supply growth = inflation

### Fisher

real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate

### Unexpected Inflation

Unexpected high inflation helps borrowers and harms loaners.

See [[Ch13 中央銀行的功能與政策目標#物價穩定]]


## Ch28 Unemployment

### terminology

- employed = paid employees || self-employed || unpaid workers in a family business
- unemployed = not employed but have looked for a job within the last 4 weeks
- not in labor force = else

### measurements

- population = employed + unemployed + not in labor force
- labor force = employed + unemployed
- unemployment rate (u-rate) = unemployed / labor force
	- does not distinguish between full-time & part-time 
- labor-force participation rate (LFPR) = labor force / adult population

### structural unemployment

![[pmacro-wage-labor.png]]

## Ch32

NCO = net capital outflow

### loanable funds market

$$S=I+NCO$$

- supply = national saving $S$
- demand = domestic investment $I$ + net capital outflow $NCO$

![[p-macro-88.png]]

### foreign-currency exchange market

$$NCO=NX$$

- supply = $NCO$ net capital outflow
- demand = $NX$ net export

![[p-macro-ex.png]]

## Ch33 Aggregate Demand and Supply

### Economic Flunctations

- economic flunctuations are irregular and unpredictable
- most macroeconomic quantities flunctuate together
- when output falls, unemployment rises

### Aggregated Demand

We know $Y = C + I + G + NX$, assuming $G$ no change, $P$ has a negative effect on $Y$

- P down -> value of money up, wealth up -> $C$ up, $I$ up -> interest rate down -> $NX$ up
- vice versa

### Aggrega Short Run Supply

In the short run, [[#Classical Economics Assumptions]] don't apply. Changes in nominal variables may affect real ones.

![[p-macro-1.png]]

### Aggregated Long Run Supply

$Y_N$ = natural rate of output = potential output = full-employment output

Long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical since the natural rate of output $Y_N$ is determined by labor, capital, natural resources, and the level of technology, which are not dependent on the price level. It's the **classical dichotomy**.

$P_E$ = the expected price to prevail in the long run

![[p-macro-long-run.png]]

inflation

![[p-macro-eq.png]]

### Theories for Short Run Supply being upward

short-run aggregate-supply curve

$$Y=Y_N+a(P-P_E)$$

- $Y_N$ = long run output
- $P$ = actualy price level
- $P_E$ = expected price level

#### Sticky-Wage Theory

- nominal wages is contant in the short run, based on $P_E$
- $P$ up but wage stays the same -> more revenue -> increase $Y$ & employment

#### Stick-Price Theory

- many price is constant in the short run
- $P$ up but product price stays the same -> product becomes relatively cheaper -> more demand -> increase $Y$ and employment

#### Misperceptions Theory

- $P$ up -> firm thinks its relative price rises -> increase $Y$ and employment
