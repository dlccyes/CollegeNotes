## Ch23 GDP

### Nominal GDP

See [[Macroeconomics#Ch2 產出與物價的衡量]]

simplified diagram

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-1.png]]

### GDP Deflator

See [[Macroeconomics#GDP 平減指數 (GDP Deflator)]]

GDP deflator = $\dfrac{\text{target year nominal GDP}}{\text{real GDP} = \text{base year prices}\times\text{target year quantities}}$

- uses base year prices
- will underestimate inflation

## Ch24 Cost of Living

### CPI

See [[Macroeconomics#消費者物價指數 (CPI, consumer price index)]]

CPI = $\dfrac{\text{target year basket price}}{\text{base year basket price}}$

- uses fixed quantities i.e. a basket of goods
- will overestimate inflation
	- price of good A rises -> consumption of A reduces, but the quantity of it in the basket doesn't change -> overestimate CPI changes
	- new goods introduced in the market -> more alternatives -> less consmption on original goods -> original goods' prices rise -> overstate cost of living
	- quality of goods increases -> price increases -> overstate cost of living

### Interest Rate

real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate

## Ch25 Production and Growth

### Production Function

$$Y=A\times f(L,K,H,N)$$

- $A$ = level of technology
	- technology development of the whole society
- $L$ = labor
- $K$ = physical capital
	- machines, equipments, structures, etc.
- $H$ = human capital
	- knowledge and skills of labor
- $N$ = natural resources
	- price natural resources are stable or falling
	- meaning technology improvement mitigates the depletion of natural resources

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-6.png]]

### Constant return to scale

If all inputs change by x%, then the output will also change by x%

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-7.png]]

### Things that help the economy

- education
- health and nutrition
- property rights
	- honoring contracts
- political stability
	- uncertainty for property rights
- free trade
	- countries disallowing free trade generally fail to grow
- population growth
	- market
	- technology progress

## Ch26 Saving, Investment, and the Financial System

See [[Macroeconomics#支出面]]

$$Y = C + I + G + NX$$

- $Y$ = total expenditure = total income
- $C$ = consumption
- $I$ = investment
	- purchase of new capital
	- securities (e.g. stock & bonds) are not capital so not investment
- $G$ = government purchases
- $NX$ = net exports

### Savings

$$S=Y-C-G=(Y-T-C)+(T-G)$$

- $S$ = national saving = private saving + public saving
- $Y-T-C$ = private saving
	- income - tax - consumption
- $T-G$ = public saving
	- tax revenue - government spending

### Loanable Funds Market

- supply = savings
- demand = investment

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-8.png]]

## Ch27 Finance 101

### Risk

concave utility funcion -> risk averse

$$u(E(X))>E(u(X))$$

See this utility vs. wealth diagram, with the green line being the person's utility funciton.

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-9.png]]

$$u(a\cdot C^H+b\cdot C^L)>a\cdot u(C^H)+b\cdot u(C^L)$$

$$a+b=1$$

Any risk combination of 0 & 1 will have the final utility fall on the red line, whereas a certain holding of the same expected wealth will fall on the green line, which is always above the red line, meaning this person is risk averse.

See also [[Ch18 Risk and Uncertainty]]

### Efficient Markets Hypothesis

- asset price reflecs all publicly available information the value of the asset
- stock price is random

## Ch29 The Monetary System

### The Money Stock

About M1 & M2, see [[Ch3 貨幣與支付系統#貨幣總計數]]

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-10.png]]

### Bank Reserves

See [[Ch15 準備貨幣與貨幣的創造#15.4 存款貨幣的創造]]

money supply = money / reserve rate

Suppose total currency = $1 and reserve rate = R, and there is an infinite number of banks

A deposits 1 to bank A -> B borrows 1-R from bank A and deposits it to bank B -> C borrows (1-R)(1-R) from bank B and deposits it to bank C -> ... -> 1/R of deposits in the system

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-13.png]]

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-14.png]]

### Balance Sheet

leverage = assets / capital = assets / assets - liabilities

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-15.png]]

### Fed

See also [[Ch16 傳統與非傳統的貨幣政策工具]]

- Open Market Operations
	- See [[Ch16 傳統與非傳統的貨幣政策工具#16.3 公開市場操作 open market operation]]
	- buy & sell government bonds to change money supply
	- ![[principle-of-macroeconomics-16.png]]
- discount window
	- bank can borrow money from Fed's discount window
	- interest rate of discount window = discount rate
- set reserve rate
- set interest rate on reserves
	- higher -> more reserves -> lower money multiplier -> lower money supply
- set federal funds rate
	- interest rate of overnight loans from one bank to another

## Ch30 Money Growth and Inflation

- price level $P$ = the price of a basket of goods
- value of money = $1/P$

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-17.png]]

### Money Demand

higher price level -> lower value of money -> higher money demand

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-18.png]]

### Classical Economics Assumptions

- classical dichotomy: nominal doesn't affect real
- neutrality of money: money supply doesn't affect real

### Velocity of Money

- price level $P$ = nominal GDP / real GDP
- velocity of money $V$ = nominal GDP / money supply

![[principle-of-macroeconomics-19.png]]

**Quantity Theory of Money**

velocity of money is stable, money supply doesn't affect real GDP, so money supply growth = inflation

### Fisher

real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate

### Unexpected Inflation

Unexpected high inflation helps borrowers and harms loaners.

See [[Ch13 中央銀行的功能與政策目標#物價穩定]]

## Ch28 Unemployment

### terminology

- employed = paid employees || self-employed || unpaid workers in a family business
- unemployed = not employed && have looked for a job within the last 4 weeks
- not in labor force = else

### measurements

- population = employed + unemployed + not in labor force
- labor force = employed + unemployed
- unemployment rate (u-rate) = unemployed / labor force
	- does not distinguish between full-time & part-time 
- labor-force participation rate (LFPR) = labor force / adult population

### structural unemployment

![[pmacro-wage-labor.png]]

## Ch31 Open Economy Basics

### saving

- NX = net export
- NCO = net capital outflow i.e. net foreign investment
	- foreign assets purchased by citizens - domestic assets purchased by foreigners

$$NX=NCO$$

$$Y=C+I+G+NX$$

$$S=Y-C-G=I+NX=I+NCO$$

saving = domestic investment + net capital outflow

### real exchange rate

real exchange rate = $e\dfrac{P}{P^*}$

- $P$ = domestic price (in home currency)
- $P^*$ = foreign price (in foreign currency)
- $e$ = nonimal exchange rate (foreign/home)

![[pmacro-33.png]]

### purchasing-power parity PPP

**theory** 

- a good has the same price everywhere i.e. a currency has the same purchasing power everywhere, otherwise there will be opportunity for arbitrage (套利空間)
- the price level difference of two countries should be reflected in the exchange rate.
	- price level changes -> nominal exchange rate changes

**limitations**

- many goods can't be easily traded i.e. arbitraged
- same good not the same in different countries i.e. preferences are not universal

## Ch32 Open Economy Theories

NCO = net capital outflow

### loanable funds market

$$S=I+NCO$$

- supply = national saving $S$
- demand = domestic investment $I$ + net capital outflow $NCO$

![[p-macro-88.png]]

### foreign-currency exchange market

$$NCO=NX$$

- supply = $NCO$ net capital outflow
- demand = $NX$ net export

![[p-macro-ex.png]]

![[pmacro-exchange.png]]

## Ch33 Aggregate Demand and Supply

### Economic Flunctations

- economic flunctuations are irregular and unpredictable
- most macroeconomic quantities flunctuate together
- when output falls, unemployment rises

### Aggregated Demand

We know $Y = C + I + G + NX$, assuming $G$ no change, $P$ has a negative effect on $Y$

- P down -> value of money up, wealth up -> $C$ up, $I$ up -> interest rate down -> $NX$ up
- vice versa

### Aggrega Short Run Supply

In the short run, [[#Classical Economics Assumptions]] don't apply. Changes in nominal variables may affect real ones.

![[p-macro-1.png]]

### Aggregated Long Run Supply

$Y_N$ = natural rate of output = potential output = full-employment output

Long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical since the natural rate of output $Y_N$ is determined by labor, capital, natural resources, and the level of technology, which are not dependent on the price level. It's the **classical dichotomy**.

$P_E$ = the expected price to prevail in the long run

![[p-macro-long-run.png]]

inflation

![[p-macro-inflation.png]]

![[p-macro-eq.png]]

### Theories for Short Run Supply being upward

short-run aggregate-supply curve

$$Y=Y_N+a(P-P_E)$$

- $Y_N$ = long run output
- $P$ = actualy price level
- $P_E$ = expected price level

#### Sticky-Wage Theory

- nominal wages is contant in the short run, based on $P_E$
- $P$ up but wage stays the same -> more revenue -> increase $Y$ & employment

#### Stick-Price Theory

- many price is constant in the short run
- $P$ up but product price stays the same -> product becomes relatively cheaper -> more demand -> increase $Y$ and employment

#### Misperceptions Theory

- $P$ up -> firm thinks its relative price rises -> increase $Y$ and employment

## Ch34 The Influence of Monetary and Fiscal Policy on Aggregate Demand

### fed monetary policy

money supply MS is fixed by the Fed

interest rate of bonds vs. quantity of money 

![[pmacro-99.png]]

![[pmacro-98.png]]

Fed can influence AD by changing MS

![[pmacro-88.png]]

### zero lower bond

[[Ch16 傳統與非傳統的貨幣政策工具#16.6 名目利率零下限問題&負利率政策]]

nominal interest rate 0 -> can't be lowered any more, need to use other ways to affect aggregate demand, production, employment etc.

- raise inflation expectation
- quantitative easing

### fiscal policy

$G$ up or $T$ down -> AD shifts right

#### multiplier effect

government purchase from firm -> 

- direct effect: AD shifts right
- income effect: firm revenue up -> worker income up -> consumption up -> AD shifts right

![[pmacro-97.png]]

the magnitude of multiplier effect depends on [[marginal propensity to consume]] MPC = $\dfrac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}$

$$\Delta Y=\Delta C +\Delta G=\mathrm{MPC}\Delta Y+\Delta G$$

$$\Delta Y=\dfrac{1}{1-\mathrm{MPC}}\Delta G$$

#### crowding-out effect

**government spending**

basically government spending reduces private consumption, see [[Macroeconomics#Ch7 靜態模型的均衡分析#政府消費支出增加]]

$G$ up ->

- AD shifts right
- $Y$ up -> MD shift right -> $r$ up -> AD shifts left
- spend on infrastructure -> increase business productivity -> AS shifts right

![[pmacro-55.png]]

**tax**

tax rate down -> more incentive to work -> labor up -> AS shifts right

### policy effectiveness

- active policy
	- investment takes time to affect interest rate
	- takes 6 months for monetary policies to affect output & employment
	- a change in government spending & tax requires congress approval, which takes time
	- since active policies take time to take effect, they're not suitable to be used for short-term goals
- automatic policy
	- tax reduces in recession naturally -> AD shifts right
	- more people use social welfare system in recession, increasing government spending naturally -> AD shits right

## Ch35 [[Philips curve]]

- in the long run, inflation & unemployment rate is unrelated
- in the short run, they are correlated

[[Philips curve]]: inflation vs. unemployment rate

### short-run

![[pmacro-76.png]]

expected inflation & SRAS given in the short run

$$u=\mathrm{NRU}-a(P-P_E)$$

### long-run

![[pmacro-887.png]]

expected inflation is adjusted to the reality in the long run

![[pmacro-78.png]]

monetary policy does not affect natural rate of X

### supply shock

supply shock affects AS & PC (philips curve)

![[pmacro-999.png]]

### disinflation

a reduction in inflation rate

sacrifice ratio = $\dfrac{\Delta \text{output}}{\Delta \text{inflation}}$ = 5 typically

reduce 5x% output to reduce x% inflation rate

if everyone's rational, expected inflation falls when the Fed accounces to reduce inflation -> PC shifts downward -> smaller unemployment rate

## Ch36 Macroeconomic Policies

See [[Ch13 中央銀行的功能與政策目標#13.4 央行制度]]

### active stabilization

- pros
	- help stablize the economy
- cons
	- policies have long delay, making them ineffective

### government spending

- aggregate demand directly boosted
- give money to the states to maintain the employment of their workers

### tax cut

- increase consumer income -> increase consumption
- higher wage -> increase the incentive to work -> increase aggregate supply
- may increase aggregate demand with investment tax credit etc.

### policy discretion

- pros
	- flexible
	- hard to specify rules
- cons
	- abuse
	- political business cycle
	- time-inconsistency

### zero inflation

- pros
	- temporary costs but permanent benefits
		- cost i.e. unemployment rate can be reduced if Fed's credible -> expected inflation rate reflects policy
- cons
	- small benefits big cost i.e. unemployment rate
		- sacrifice ratio = 5
	- investment reduced

### balanced budget i.e. no deficits

- why deficits bad
	- debt places burden on future generations
	- deficits crowd out investment
		- sell government bonds for funding -> soak up money otherwise used for investment on business
- why deficits not so bad
	- burden placed on a person from government debt is tiny
	- harm of cutting deficits
		- social welfare reduced
		- tax increased
	- what important is debt/income ratio not the absolute debt amount

### tax reform to encourage saving

- why Murica needs tax reform to encourage saving
	- current Murica tax system descourages saving
		- high marginal tax rate (of income) -> less incentive to save
		- some saving is taxed twice
		- high tax rate on bequests
	- can replace income tax with consumption tax to incentivize saving
		- should exempt on necessities, otherwise it's just eating the poor
- why Murica doesn't need tax reform to encourage saving
	- tax reform encouraging saving just benefits the rich
	- elasticity of saving on rate of return is low, so tax reform won't do much
	- may increase government budge deficits -> lower public saving, cancelling out the increase of private saving
	- can increase national saving simply by reducing budge deficit
