# Ch11 Market Power, Collusion, and Oligopoly

[Notes](https://hackmd.io/lgE6h18aSzyV4I7PrE0zzg)

## Merger
### horizontal integration
before merger: competitive (to where D=MC)  
after merger: MC drops
![[ch11-market-power,-colusion,-and-obligopoly-1.png]]
don't necessarily gain

if MC' << MC
![[ch11-market-power,-colusion,-and-obligopoly-2.png]]  
P' lower than before merger  
and both consumers & producer gain

if MC' = MC  
![[ch11-market-power,-colusion,-and-obligopoly-3.jpg]]
deadweight loss

### vertical integration
Say there's a upstream monopoly and downstream monopoly respectively. Upstream company would sell a monopoly price for downstream company, which is a part of the MC of downstream company. When they merge, Upstream would produces at MC = D, lowering the MC of downstream.

## Oligopoly
### cartel
> A group of firms engaged in collusion  

will fail due to prison dilemma, unless repeated

### contestable market
firm can enter & exit costlessly

P=MC=AC

[[natural monopoly]] in a contestable market

### Cournot model

[[Cournot Model]]
==assumption: the rival has fixed quantity== i.e. take rivals' output as given
![[ch11-market-power,-colusion,-and-obligopoly-8.png]]

### Bertrand model

[[Bertrand Model]]

==assumption: the rival has fixed price== i.e. take rivals' price as given, and assume the rival won't change it → will undercut its price as long as > MC s.t. it can capture the entire market → repeatedly undercut each's price → ==price = MC = competition price==

### about Cournot & Bertrand model

if the assumptions fail, which is always the case, the models won't work

## monopolistic competition

- [monopolistic competition](../../../obs_autolink/monopolistic%20competition)
- producing a product that **differs sufficiently from the output of other producers** that some consumers will have a distinct preference for it
- basically same products with different branding
- demand very elastic
- Q = where MR = MC
- short run : positive economic profits
- long run : zero economic profits
	- TR = TC i.e. P = AC

### N2
![[ch11-market-power,-colusion,-and-obligopoly-11.png]]
N2(b) N 先根據 $P_M$ 定出 $P_N$ 定出 Q，M 再根據 Q 定出 $P_M$
### N3

### N4

橋有先後  
i.e. 2nd bridge take 1st as given in (b)  
thus idendical with N2(b)
