# Ch7 Competition

## 7.1 The Competitive Firm

marginal revenue = price
a firm's output: where price = MC (marginal cost)

### U-shaped MC curve

![[ch7-competition-1.png]]
if lost in [0,Q<sub>1</sub>] < profit in [Q<sub>1</sub>,Q<sub>2</sub>] → produce Q<sub>2</sub>  
else → shut down

**short run**: can shutdown  
**long run**: can exit

### shut down or not ?

operate profit: TR(total revenue) - TC(total cost)  
shut down profit: -FC (fixed cost)  
TC = FC + VC (variable cost)  
operate if operate profit > shut down profit i.e. TR > VC  
(bc fixed cost is there whether shut down or not, so only variable cost matters)  
TR = P×Q > VC  
→ ==P > AVC== i.e. **price > average variable cost** then a firm operate

bold part = supply curve  
(**only produce when P=MC>AVC**)
![[ch7-competition-2.png]]
produce nothing at price < P<sub>0</sub>

MC intersect AVC & AC at min point

原因：marginal < average 時，會讓 average 減少；> average 時，會讓 average 增加，又 fixed cost 不變

### elasticity of supply

<!-- elasticity = $$\frac{\frac{△Q}{Q}}{\frac{△P}{P}}$$ -->
elasticity = $$\frac{△Q/Q}{△P/P}$$
(the flatter the higher)
<!-- $$(1+3)/3$$
\\\[display\\\]
\[70/2\]
<!-- $x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2b}.$
$$\frac{3}{4}$$ -->

## 7.2 The Competitive Industry in the Short Run

### changes in variable costs

![[ch7-competition-5.png]]

a firm:  

- marginal cost rises → supply curve shifts upward/leftward
- in industry, price = P<sub>0</sub> → P<sub>2</sub>, so d→d' in a firm, q<sub>2</sub> not necessarily < q<sub>0</sub>  

an industry:  

- the sum of firms' supply curves → shifts upward/leftward  
- Q<sub>2</sub> < Q<sub>0</sub>

### a change in demand

## 7.3 The Competitive Firm in the Long Run

min AC point = equilibrium quantity q&p (horizontal demand i.e. price is the tangent of min AC)

- if p > AC, the firm is earning positive economic profits, so more firms will come in, making p decreases
- if p < AC, the firm is earning negative economic profits, so it will quit

i.e. in long run, price = min AC

P<sub>0</sub>→P<sub>1</sub>
short run: S  
long run: LRS, S'

p.183

## 7.4 The Competitive Industry in the Long Run

### change in demand 

#### constant-cost

long run: price don't change

![[ch7-competition-8.png]]

short run: price goes up

![[ch7-competition-9.png]]

### change in cost

#### constant-cost

changes in variable cost

![[ch7-competition-10.png]]

如果每單位 output 上升相同的 marginal cost，AC 就會垂直上升，讓均衡 output 不變  
但若是 variable cost 按比例上升，output 愈大 marginal cost 上升愈多

![[ch7-competition-12.jpg]]

短期才會有好處
長期而言都是 0 profit

#### increasing-cost

same as constant-cost except the shape of LRS

### applications

1. apartment rent for $400
2. new law: $200 max
3. change to $20p
4. remove law
5. change to $500
6. change back to $400 ultimately

## 7.5 XXXX-Cost Industries

### Constant-Cost Industries

break-even price (price that makes you profit = 0 ) is constant as q ↑

### Increasing-Cost Industries

break-even price ↑ as q ↑

可能原因

- break-even price 較低者較早進入市場，較高者較晚進入
- factor price ↑ as q ↑ e.g. lands

### Decreasing-Cost industries

costs ↓ as q ↑ → break-even price ↓ as q ↑ e.g. 3C industry
