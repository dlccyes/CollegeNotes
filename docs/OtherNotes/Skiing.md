## Tips

### Turn

When doing left turn

- left lean s.t. your body's middle line is on top of the left board, but put the weight on the right foot -> right board will left turn
- left rotate your left foot i.e. move emphasis for left foot to little toe -> left board will follow the right board i.e. left turn

vice versa

### Getting up from the ground

Make your feet i.e. boards toward the valley and head toward the hill, and push the ground with your hands, now you're up on your feet again.

### Attaching boards on a hill

Attach bottom board -> attach top board

#### Green line 

**Difficulty (IMO)**

G1 >= E1 > D1 > H2 > H1

**D1**

A wide course between the woods. Good view, relatively 豐富 terrains.

**E1**

The first third is a pretty steep slope, the next 2/3 is not, but the speed is accumulated from before, plus the whole course is very straight with no natural stopping points, so this one is actually pretty tiring. You'll maintain a pretty high speed for a few consequtive minutes .

There isn't much view in this course, so it's rather boring. However, there are some obstacles for snowboarder to play some stunts.

**G1**

A snowy mountain terrain, pretty cool. There is even a short path into the woods (and out). There are some steep slopes in this course tho, but they're optional.


**H1**

The beginner course.

**H2**

The begginer course but with slightly steeper slope.
