## Trails Difficulties

The difficulty of a trail depends on the slope, the terrain and the covering snow. They are decided by the resorts, but if generally, if we only look at the slope, it is like this

- Green
	- $\angle 5 \sim 15 ^\circ$
- Blue
	- $\angle 15 \sim 25 ^\circ$
- Black
	- $\angle 25 \sim 35 ^\circ$

## Tips

### Stance

**Always** keep your center of mass at the front, and keep your hands steady at the front even (or especially) when doing turns. Stay low when on steep slopes.

### Turn

When doing a left turn:

- left lean s.t. your body's middle line is on top of the left ski, but put the weight on the right foot -> right ski will left turn
- left rotate your left foot i.e. move emphasis for left foot to little toe -> left ski will follow the right ski i.e. left turn

vice versa

### Getting up from the ground

Make your feet i.e. skis toward the valley and head toward the hill, and push the ground with your hands, now you're up on your feet again.

### Attaching skis on a hill

Attach bottom ski -> attach top ski

### Getting back your poles and skis when falling down on a steep slope

Stop yourself from slipping and pray for some snowboarders to get them back to you

### Naeba Ski Resort

This resort is based on a small mountain. The trails are generally straightforward slopes with not many trees and and little variety., except for the leftmost and rightmost parts. On the trails at the bottom part, you'll see Naeba Prince Hotel.

#### Blue Lines

**A1**

大斜面 is a very long slope. The first third is a very steep and icy (depends on many things obviosly but at the time I skiied at least 🥲) slope. If you slipped there, you may find it difficult to stop yourself. This trail is very hostile toward beginners.

**F1 & G3**

These 2 trails are very straight slopes, right next to each other. It's fairly steep, but the snow cover is also pretty fluffy, so it's not a hard course even for beginners as long as you know all the basics and be careful.

These 2 trails can be accessed from either lift F or G.

#### Green Lines

**H1**

The beginner course.

**H2**

The beginner course but with slightly steeper slope.

**E1**

The first third is a pretty steep slope, the next 2/3 is not, but the speed is accumulated from before, plus the whole course is very straight with no natural stopping points, so this one is actually pretty tiring if you're bad.

There isn't much view in this course, so it's rather boring. However, there are some bumps for snowboarder to play some stunts.

**G1**

A snowy mountain terrain, pretty cool. There is even a short path into the woods (and out). There are some steep slopes in this course tho, but they're optional.

**DG1 / C1**

A pretty narrow trail to connect L1 from lift G. Not too challenging tho.

**L1 & G2**

Wide trails between the woods.

**D1**

A wide course between the woods. Good view with relatively 豐富 terrains. If you like this kind of trails, go to [[#Tashira Area]].

### Kagura Ski Resort

**Map**

**trails Info**

![](https://i.imgur.com/rYMG8fq.png)

There are 3 areas in Kagura Ski Resort, Tashira, Kagura, and Mitsumata. You can access this resort with a ropeway from [[#Naeba Ski Resort]], however, the operation time window of the ropeway is fairly narrow, so it' will be quite difficult to access the Mitsumata area or even Kagura if you live at Naeba Prince Hotel.
 
#### Tashira Area

**田代**

The Tashira area can be directly accessed from [[#Naeba Ski Resort]] through a 20 min.  ropeway. The area is consist of a sparse forest and a lake, however, even the nearest trail is a bit far from the lake. The trails in this area are generally long, wide, beginner-friendly, and are in the woods. This area feels much more natural than [[#Naeba Ski Resort]].

One need to be aware that many trails interleave with each other, so be sure that the path you take is the one you want.
