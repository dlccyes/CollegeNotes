# Paragliding

- AoA (angle of attack) = angle between the wind and the canopy
    - ![[paragliding-aoa.png]]
    - wind blowing horizontally while the wing & you are perpendicular to the ground -> AoA = 0
    - if wind blows straight up to your canopy -> AoA = 90
    - high AoA -> high lift
- brake
    - brake -> wing slows down, dragging behind you -> AoA increase -> lift increase
- airspeed is relative to the air, groundspeed is relative to the ground
