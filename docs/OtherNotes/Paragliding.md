# Paragliding

- AoA (angle of attack) = angle between the wind and the canopy
    - ![[paragliding-aoa.png]]
    - wind blowing horizontally while the wing & you are perpendicular to the ground -> AoA = 0
    - if wind blows straight up to your canopy -> AoA = 90
    - high AoA -> high lift
- brake
    - brake -> wing slows down, dragging behind you -> AoA increase -> lift increase
- trim speed = natural paraglider air speed without any brake
- airspeed is relative to the air, groundspeed is relative to the ground
- glide ratio = horizontal speed / vertical speed
    - when no wind (or relative to the air), glide ratio = $\dfrac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}=\cot\theta$
    - $\theta$ = the angle between your speed and horizon
- L/D (lift to drag) ratio = lift force / drag force = $\dfrac{W\cos\theta}{W\sin\theta}=\cot\theta$ 
    - lift force: perpendicular to your speed
    - drag force: parallel but opposite direction to your speed
    - beginner paraglider: 8:1
- polar curve: horizontal speed vs. vertical speed in different angle of attacks
    - ![[para-polar.png]]
    - better paragliders have flatter polar curves

## right of way

- Pilots approaching head-on should both yield to the right.
- The lower pilot has the right of way.
- The pilot with the ridge/mountain on their right has the right of way.
- P Pass other pilots between them and the hill.
- The first pilot in a thermal sets the direction of turn.
- All pilots must turn the same direction in a thermal.
- Enter thermals tangentially to the circles other pilots are already making.

## wing

- thermal
    - dry, hot, high altitude -> strong thermal
    - 10F difference every 3000ft -> soarable and smooth, 12.5F -> thermic, 15F -> strong
    - lower pressure, more thermal
        - pressure too low -> extreme thermal & thunderstorm
    - rise and fall with the sun
- lee and rotor
    - lee-side = rotor zone = 背風面
