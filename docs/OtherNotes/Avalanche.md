### Avalanche Types

- character
    - ![[avi-types.png]]
    - Dry Loose: Release of dry unconsolidated snow. These avalanches typically occur within layers of soft snow near the surface of the snowpack. Loose-dry avalanches start at a point and entrain snow as they move downhill, forming a fan-shaped avalanche. Other names for loose-dry avalanches include point-release avalanches or sluffs. Loose-dry avalanches can trigger slab avalanches that break into deeper snow layers.
    - Wet Loose: Release of wet unconsolidated snow or slush. These avalanches typically occur within layers of wet snow near the surface of the snowpack, but they may quickly gouge into lower snowpack layers. Like Loose-Dry Avalanches, they start at a point and entrain snow as they move downhill, forming a fan-shaped avalanche. They generally move slowly, but can contain enough mass to cause significant damage to trees, cars or buildings. Other names for loose-wet avalanches include point-release avalanches or sluffs. Loose-wet avalanches can trigger slab avalanches that break into deeper snow layers.
    - Wind Slab: Release of a cohesive layer of snow (a slab) formed by the wind. Wind typically erodes snow from the upwind sides of terrain features and deposits snow on the downwind side. Wind slabs are often smooth and rounded and sometimes sound hollow, and can range from soft to hard. Wind slabs that form over a persistent weak layer (surface hoar, depth hoar, or near-surface facets) may be termed Persistent Slabs or may develop into Persistent Slabs.
        - ![[avi-wind-slab.jpg]]
        - This is a wind slab avalanche.  You can see that the slab tapers from lookers right to left.  This wind slab was caused due to winds that cross-loaded the small gully as the wind deposited snow and formed the slab in the terrain feature.  The wind that formed this slab was blowing from right to left in the photograph. The wind work hardened the slab and led to the blocky debris.    
    - Storm Slab: Release of a soft cohesive layer (a slab) of new snow which breaks within the storm snow or on the old snow surface. Storm-slab problems typically last between a few hours and few days. Storm-slabs that form over a persistent weak layer (surface hoar, depth hoar, or near-surface facets) may be termed Persistent Slabs or may develop into Persistent Slabs.
    - Wet Slab: Release of a cohesive layer of snow (a slab) that is generally moist or wet when the flow of liquid water weakens the bond between the slab and the surface below (snow or ground). They often occur during prolonged warming events and/or rain-on-snow events. Wet slabs can be very destructive.
        - ![[avi-wet-slab.jpg]]
        - This is a wet slab avalanche. From the photograph of the avalanche alone, it might be difficult to determine the avalanche problem that caused this avalanche.  Although the small wet loose slides indicate it was warm.  There is also no new snow in the trees, so the avalanche was not during a new snow or wind loading event.  The debris pile has the look of classic wet slab debris that has been subjected to warm temperatures and liquid water.
    - Persistent Slab: Release of a cohesive layer of soft to hard snow (a slab) in the middle to upper snowpack, when the bond to an underlying persistent weak layer breaks. Persistent layers include: surface hoar, depth hoar, near- surface facets, or faceted snow. Persistent weak layers can continue to produce avalanches for days, weeks or even months, making them especially dangerous and tricky. As additional snow and wind events build a thicker slab on top of the persistent weak layer, this avalanche problem may develop into a Persistent, Deep-Slab.
    - Deep Persistent Slab: Release of a thick cohesive layer of hard snow (a slab), when the bond breaks between the slab and an underlying persistent weak layer, deep in the snowpack or near the ground. The most common  persistent weak layers involved in deep, persistent slabs are depth hoar, deeply-buried surface hoar, or facets surrounding a deeply-buried crust. Persistent, Deep-Slabs are typically hard to trigger, are very destructive and dangerous due to the large mass of snow involved, and can persist for months once developed. They are often triggered from areas where the snow is shallow and weak, and are particularly difficult to forecast for and manage. They commonly develop when Persistent Slabs become more deeply-buried over time.
    - Cornice Fall: Release of an overhanging mass of snow that forms as the wind moves snow over a sharp terrain feature, such as a ridge, and deposits snow on the down-wind side. They range from small wind lips of soft snow to large overhangs of hard snow that are 30 feet (~10 meters) or taller. They can break off the terrain suddenly and pull back onto the ridge top and catch people by surprise even on the flat ground above the slope. Even small cornices can have enough mass to be destructive and deadly. Cornice fall can entrain loose surface snow or trigger slab avalanches.
    - Glide: Release of the entire snow cover as a result of gliding over the ground. Glide avalanches can be composed of wet, moist, or almost entirely dry snow. They typically occur in very specific paths, where the slope is steep enough and the ground surface is relatively smooth. There are often proceeded by full depth cracks (glide cracks), though the time between the appearance of a crack and an avalanche can vary between seconds and months. Glide avalanches are unlikely to be triggered by a person, are nearly impossible to forecast, and thus pose a hazard that is extremely difficult to manage. Predicting the release of Glide Avalanches is very challenging. Because Glide Avalanches only occur on very specific slopes, safe travel relies on identifying and avoiding those slopes. Glide cracks are a significant indicator, as are recent Glide Avalanches

## Avalanche Triangle

- Terrain
    - mostly on 30-45 degree slope
        - or slope attached to steep slope
        - > 45 snow just skips off immediately without the chance of forming a slab

- Snowpack
    - slab
        - packed snow / snow layer sticked together
    - weak layer

- Weather
- Human Factor
    - use checklist to manage it

### Terrain

#### windloading

- top loading
    - ![[avi-top-loading.jpg]]
- cross loading

#### sun

- shady area has more persistent weak layers than sunny area
- sun strengthen layers

#### vegetation

#### altitude

- high altitude - more wind
- low altitude - more rain

#### runout angle

### Snowback

#### formation of slab

strong cohesive layer

- rounding
    - at mild temperature gradient, < 1 C per 10cm
    - ![[avi-slab-rounding.png]]
- wind

#### formation of weak layer 

- faceting
    - at strong temperature gradient, > 1 C per 10cm
    - ![[avi-weak-form.png]]
    - water vapir crystalized because of cold
- depth hoar
    - stronger facet
- surface hoar
    - like frost but vapor frozen directly without going through liquid phase
    - happens at night when radiation radiated into open sky, causing surface temp to drop
    - disrupted if not under open sky e.g. trees clouds

#### trigger points

- thin areas
- rocks & trees
- convexities
- cliff

#### Tests

- informat
    - pole
    - hand
    - switchback: jumping with skis
- pit: dig a pit to check the layers
    - put shovel on the surface and knock on it to check if the top layer falls
    - spacial variability exists, 1 snow pit is just 1 sample

### Weather

#### percipitation
