## Avalanche Triangle

![[avi-triangle.png]]

- Terrain
    - mostly on 30-45 degree slope
        - or slope attached to steep slope
        - > 45 snow just skips off immediately without the chance of forming a slab
    - ![[avi-slope-cdf.png]]
- Snowpack
    - slab
        - packed snow / snow layer sticked together
    - weak layer
    - bed surface
- Weather
- Human Factor
    - use checklist to manage it

### Terrain

websites for terrains

- [Caltopo](www.caltopo.com)
- [GaiaGPS](www.gaiagps.com)
- onX Backcountry (paid)

#### windloading

- top loading
    - ![[avi-top-loading.jpg]]
- cross loading
    - ![[avi-cross-loading.jpg]]

#### sun

- shady area has more persistent weak layers than sunny area
- sun strengthen layers

#### vegetation

![[avi-tree.jpg]]

#### altitude

- high altitude - more wind
- low altitude - more rain

#### runout angle

![[avi-runout.png]]

### Snowback

#### formation of slab

strong cohesive layer

- rounding
    - at mild temperature gradient, < 1 C per 10cm
    - ![[avi-slab-rounding.png]]
- wind

#### formation of weak layer 

- faceting
    - at strong temperature gradient, > 1 C per 10cm
    - ![[avi-weak-form.png]]
    - water vapir crystalized because of cold
- depth hoar
    - stronger facet
- surface hoar
    - like frost but vapor frozen directly without going through liquid phase
    - happens at night when radiation radiated into open sky, causing surface temp to drop
    - disrupted if not under open sky e.g. trees clouds

#### trigger points

- thin areas
- rocks & trees
- convexities
- cliff

#### Tests

- informat
    - pole
    - hand
    - switchback: jumping with skis
- pit: dig a pit to check the layers
    - put shovel on the surface and knock on it to check if the top layer falls
    - spacial variability exists, 1 snow pit is just 1 sample

### Weather

#### percipitation

- red flags
    - 6+" of snow in 6hr
    - 12+" of snow in 24hr
    - rain on dry snow
- ![[avi-snowfall-rate.jpg]]

#### wind

- 10mph can move snow
- red flags
    - 15mph+ for several hours
    - bring snow to the lee side

#### temperature

- red flags
    - 12+F change in 12 hours
    - temperature rising above freezing

## Terminology

#### loose

- cohesionless
- i.e. sluff / point release


#### slab

- cohesive snow
- parts
    - crown
    - flanks
    - bed surface
    - stauchwall: bottom boundary
- types
    - hard slab
    - soft slab
    - wet slab
    - hang fire

#### glide

entire snowpack released as a unit

#### anatomy

- start zone
    - 30-45 deg
- track
- runout: decelerate zone

#### shorthands

### Avalanche Problem

## Avalanche Types

![[avi-fatality-type.jpg]]

### Loose

- dry loose
- wet loose
    - heavier so hits harder

### Slab

![[avi-prb-slab.jpg]]

![[avi-slab-hazard.png]]

- storm slab
    - reliable to predict & test
    - remote trigger unlikely
    - warm to cold -> heavy below light snow -> good
    - cold to warm -> light below heavy snow -> recipe for avi
- wind slab
    - mostly reliable to predict & test
    - remote trigger unlikely but possible
    - ![[avi-wind-slab.jpg]]
        - This is a wind slab avalanche. You can see that the slab tapers from lookers right to left. This wind slab was caused due to winds that cross-loaded the small gully as the wind deposited snow and formed the slab in the terrain feature.  The wind that formed this slab was blowing from right to left in the photograph. The wind work hardened the slab and led to the blocky debris.  
- wet slab
    - remote trigger unlikely
    - unreliable prediction & test
    - see season history
    - ![[avi-wet-slab.jpg]]
        - This is a wet slab avalanche. From the photograph of the avalanche alone, it might be difficult to determine the avalanche problem that caused this avalanche.  Although the small wet loose slides indicate it was warm.  There is also no new snow in the trees, so the avalanche was not during a new snow or wind loading event.  The debris pile has the look of classic wet slab debris that has been subjected to warm temperatures and liquid water.
- persistent slab
    - unpredictable
    - can be triggered remotely
    - unreliable prediction & test
- deep slab
    - deeper persistent slab

## Decision Making

ALPTRUTh

90% of avi accidents happen when 3+ of ALPTRUTh are present

![[avi-alptruth.jpg]]

- A: Avalanche. Have there been any avalanches in the last 48 hours?
- L: Loading. Has there been any loading by snow, wind, or rain in the last 48 hours?
- P: Path. Is there a noticeable and obvious avalanche path, even by a novice?
- T: Terrain Trap. Is there a terrain trap present, such as gullies, trees, cliffs or other features that increase the severity of being caught?
- R: Rating. Is the rating of today’s avalanche report CONSIDERABLE, HIGH or EXTREME?
- U: Unstable snow. Are there any signs of unstable snow such as cracking, collapsing, or whoomping?
- TH: THaw instability. Has there been recent, rapid warming of the snow surface due to sun, wind, rain, or air temperature?

## Backcountry Planning

- Munter Method
    - 1 travel unit = 
        - 100m vert
        - 1km horizontal (or route distance?)
    - standard rate
        - uphill 4 units / hr
        - downhill 10 units / hr
    - time = vert + horizontal / rate
