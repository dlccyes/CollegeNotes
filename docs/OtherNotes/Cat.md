## Cat Foods

The ideal cat food is an animal, meaning 70% water + 10+% protein from meat. So raw food is the best, or pick the canned wet food with similar composition.

### Why dry food bad

Dry food is heavily processed meat with 50% carb, which strays away from the ideal cat food. It's basically like Muricans eating burgers every day, making them obese.

Cats are from the desert as well and get most of the hydration from food instead of running water. So feeding them dry food will dehydrate them.

### Wet food tips

- the more proteins from meat the better 
- the less the followings the better
    - vegetables, carrageenan, phospate
