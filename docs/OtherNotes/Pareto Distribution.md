# Pareto Distribution

$P(X>x)\propto x^{-\alpha}$

e.g. the probability of a city to have over 10k people $\propto$ $10000^{-\alpha}$

special case where $\alpha=1$ -> Zipf's Law of Frequency,   
where size $\propto \dfrac{1}{\text{rank}}$

e.g. NYC (US No.1)'s population is x2 of LA (US No.2), x3 of Chicago (US No.3)
