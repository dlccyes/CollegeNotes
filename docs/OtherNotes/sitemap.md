I have plenty of standalone sites, each with different purpose.

This one is for preserving long term notes. Basically intended to be a personal wiki. It is mostly consist of technical emotionless notes for now, but I may add more personal contents in the future.

## [Blog](https://dlccyes.github.io/blog) 

For blogging short term moods, thoughts, experiences and reviews.

## [Books wiki](https://dlccyes.github.io/books) 

A roam research style notebook for my book notes, including the books I read, my reviews, the plots, and even the world settings and the characters of the books. That's said, there's only Cosmere related contents for now.
