# Research 101

## Paper Writing Flow

1. Complete your research and obtain your results
2. Decide on a conference or journal to submit to
3. Find about 5 past papers of the conference/journal relavant to your topic and extract the format of the conference/journal down to the paragraph level
4. Add your contents into the outline you just made
5. Find the latex template of the conference/journal with this [template selector](https://template-selector.ieee.org/secure/templateSelector/publicationType)  (for IEEE ones)
6. Fill your contents into the template. You can use Overleaf or VsCode to deal with latex. See [[latex#Environment]].
