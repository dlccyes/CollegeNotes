## get original version of Jupyter Notebook

This procedure will reset your notebook while keeping a copy of your version.

1. open two tabs of the notebook
2. in the first tab rename it, append `?forceRefresh=true` to the url, and hit enter
3. refresh the second tab

Now the first tab becomes the old copy and the second tab becomes the original version
