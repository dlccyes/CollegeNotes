# Hedonic Game

> In this paper, we examine the purely hedonic aspect of coalition formation. This terminology follows Dreze and Greenberg (1980), who call the dependence of a player’s utility on the iden- tity of the members of her coalition the “hedonic aspect.” Essentially, the purely hedonic problem that we examine here boils coalition formation down to its purest social form: **the payoff to a player depends only on the composition of members of the coalition to which she belongs**.
