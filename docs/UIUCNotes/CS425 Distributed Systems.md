## Gossip

### Multicast Protocols


- send info to multiple nodes
- fault tolerant
- available
- scalable
- application level

#### Centralized

- one node send info to multiple nodes directly
    - with a loop
- not fault tolerant
    - fails halfway through the loop -> a lot don't receive
- high latency $O(N)$

#### Tree-based

- fault tolerant 
    - if a node on the higher hierarchy fails, lots of the nodes won't receive
    - use ACK or NAK to repair
        - can add random delay & use exponential backoff to avoid too much ACK/NAK
- latency $O(\log N)$ if balanced
- high overhead of $O(N)$ ACK/NAK

### Epidemic Multicast / Gossip Protocol

#### push gossip

- receive message -> push to a random set of nodes
- if received multiple messages, push a subset of them by random / recency / priority
- the spread
    - $n+1$ nodes
    - $x_t$ = uninfected notes at $t$
    - $y_t$ = infected notes at $t$
    - $x_t+y_t=n+1$
    - $x_0=n$ 
    - $y_0=1$ (root)
    - $\dfrac{dx}{dt}=-\beta xy$ = infection rate
        - $xy$ = the number of possible contacts between the uninfected & infected at a given time
        - $0\leq\beta\leq 1$, the fraction that actuall happens
    - $x=\dfrac{n(n+1)}{n+e^{\beta(n+1)t}}$
    - $y=\dfrac{n+1}{1+ne^{-\beta(n+1)t}}$
- the convergence
    - $\beta=\dfrac{b}{n}$, $b$ is the fanout
    - $t=c\log(n)$
    - $x\approx\dfrac{1}{n^{cb-2}}$
        - for $b=c=2$, $x=\dfrac{1}{n^2}$, which is close to 0
    - meaning the gossip converges in $O(\log n)$
    - each node transmits $bc\log(n)\in O(\log n)$ messages
- failures
    - packet loss
        - 50% packet drop -> analyze with $b/2$ -> 2x latency 
    - node failure
        - 50% nodes fail -> analyze with $n/2$ & $b/2$ (because 50% sent to bad nodes)
- $O(\log n)$ is practically almost constant
    - ln(1K) = 10
    - ln(1B) = 30
- pros
    - spreads quickly -> low latency
    - lightweight
    - highly fault tolerant 

#### pull gossip

- periodic pull from a random set of nodes 
- the spread
    - a tree with constant fanout / degree / num of children
    - $O(\log n)$ to spread to $n/2$
    -  $p_t$ = the fraction / ratio of uninfected nodes at $t$
    - fanout = $k$ i.e. the number of nodes to pull each iteration
    - for an uninfected node to stay uninfected at $t+1$, the $k$ nodes it pulls need to all be uninfected
    - $p_{t+1}=p_tp_t^k=p_t^{k+1}$ - super exponential
    - from $n/2$ to $n$ takes $O(\log\log n)$

#### hybrid - push pull

- use push to infect half of the nodes in $O(\log n)$
- use pull to quickly converge in $O(\log\log n)$

#### topology-aware gossip

- if nodes are distributed across data centers / racks evenly, and if push/pull randomly, router load would be $O(N)$
- ![[cs425-gossip-topology.jpg]]
- make the probability of picking outside the subnet $1/n_i$
    - $n_i$ = the num of nodes in the subnet
- router load $O(1)$
- still $O(\log n)$ spread time

#### Implementations

- AWS EC2 & S3
- [[Cassandra]]
