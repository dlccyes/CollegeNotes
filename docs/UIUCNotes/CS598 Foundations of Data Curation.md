# CS598 Foundations of Data Curation

## Intro

### Data Lifecycles Models

- USGS Science Data Lifecycle Model (SDLM)
    - ![[cs598-usgs.png]]
    - steps
        - plan
        - acquire
        - processing
        - analysis
        - preserve
        - publication/sharing
    - cross-cutting activities
        - describe (metadata, doc)
        - manage quality
        - backup & secure
- Digital Curation Center (DCC) Curation Model
    - ![[cs598-dcc.png]]
        - sequential
        - full lifecycle actions
        - occasional actions
    - repository centric
- Research Object Lifecycle Model 
    - ![[cs598-ro.png]]
    - based on research object
    - states
        - research & data management
        - active repo
        - long-term preservation

## Laws

- ![[cs598-w2-2.png]]
- de-identifying protected health information
    - safe harbor: remove 18 specific identifiers
    - expert determination: a qualified expert applies some statistical methods to make the data unable to be re-identified

## Relations

- data model
    - a type of framework (to represent info)
    - a particular framework (to represent info)
    - the application of of a particular framework (to represent info)

## Data Concepts

### basic representation model BRM

e.g.

Propositional content: X failed on 2025-10-01
→ expressed as XML text (symbol structure)  
→ encoded as UTF-8 bytes (symbol structure encoding)  
→ stored as blocks on an SSD (patterned matter/energy)
